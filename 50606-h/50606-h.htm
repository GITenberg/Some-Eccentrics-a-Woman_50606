<h2>Some Eighteenth-Century Men about Town</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span></p>



<p class="dropcap">When his Royal Highness George,
Prince of Wales, afterwards George
IV., freed himself from parental
control, and, an ill-disciplined lad, launched
himself upon the town, it is well known that
he was intimate with Charles James Fox,
whom probably he admired more because the
King hated the statesman than for any other
reason. Doubtless the Prince drank with Fox,
and diced with him, and played cards with him,
but from his later career it is obvious he can
never have touched Fox on that great man’s
intellectual side; and, after a time, the royal
scapegrace, who would rather have reigned in
hell than have served in heaven, sought companions
to whom he need not in any way feel
inferior. With this, possibly sub-conscious, desire,
he gathered around him a number of men about
town, notorious for their eccentricities and for the
irregularity of their lives. With these George
felt at home; but, though he was nominally their
leader, there can be little doubt that he was
greatly influenced by them at the most critical
time of a young man’s life, to his father’s disgust
and to the despair of the nation. Of these men
the most remarkable were Sir John Lade, George
Hanger (afterwards fourth Lord Coleraine of the
second creation), and Sir Lumley Skeffington;<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
and, by some chance, it happens that little has
been written about them, perhaps because what
has been recorded is for the most part hidden in
old magazines and newspapers and the neglected
memoirs of forgotten worthies. Yet, as showing
the temper of the times, it may not be uninteresting
to reconstruct their lives, and, as far as the
material serves, show them in their habit as
they lived.</p>

<p>Sir John Lade, the son of John Inskipp, who
assumed the name of Lade, and in whose person
the baronetcy that had been in the family was
revived, was born in 1759, and at an early age
plunged into the fast society of the metropolis
with such vigour that he had earned a most
unenviable reputation by the time he came of
age, on which auspicious occasion, Dr Johnson,
who knew him as the ward of Mr Thrale,
greeted him savagely in the satirical verses which
conclude:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Wealth, my lad, was made to wander:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Let it wander at its will;</div>
<div class="verse">Call the jockey, call the pander,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Bid them come and take their fill.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When the bonnie blade carouses,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Pockets full and spirits high&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">What are acres? what are houses?</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Only dirt, or wet and dry.</div>
</div>
<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Should the guardian friend or mother</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Tell the woes of wilful waste,</div>
<div class="verse">Scorn their counsels, scorn their pother,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">You can hang, or drown, at last.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sir John became one of the Prince of Wales’s
cronies, and for a while had the management of
his Royal Highness’s racing stable; but while it
has been hinted of him, as of George Hanger, that
during his tenure of that office he had some share
in the transactions that resulted in Sam Chifney,
the Prince’s jockey, being warned off the turf, it
is but fair to state that there is no evidence in existence
to justify the suspicion. Indeed, he seems
to have been honest, except in incurring tradesmen’s
debts that he could never hope to discharge;
but this was a common practice in fashionable
circles towards the end of the eighteenth century,
and was held to throw no discredit on the man
who did so&mdash;for was it not a practice sanctioned
by the example of “The First Gentleman of
Europe” himself?</p>

<p>Sir John’s ambition, apparently, was to imitate
a groom in dress and language. It was his pleasure
to take the coachman’s place, and drive the Prince’s
“German Waggon,<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> and six bay horses from the
Pavilion at Brighton to the Lewes racecourse;<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
and, in keeping with his <i>pose</i>, he was overheard
on Egham racecourse to invite a friend to return
to dinner in these terms:&mdash;“I can give you a trout
spotted all over like a coach dog, a fillet of veal
as white as alabaster, a ‘pantaloon’ cutlet, and
plenty of pancakes as big as coach-wheels&mdash;so
help me.”</p>

<p>Dr Johnson naturally took an interest in Sir
John, and, when Lady Lade consulted him about
the training of her son, “Endeavour, madam,”
said he, “to procure him knowledge, for really
ignorance to a rich man is like fat to a sick sheep,
it only serves to call the rooks round him.” It
is easier, however, to advocate the acquisition of
knowledge than to inculcate it, and knowledge,
except of horses, Sir John Lade never obtained in
any degree. Indeed, his folly was placed on record
by “Anthony Pasquin” in</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span></p>

<p>When Sir John was little more than a boy,
Johnson, half in earnest, proposed him as a fitting
mate for the author of “Evelina,” so Mrs Thrale
states; and, indeed, Miss Burney herself records
a conversation in 1778 between that lady and the
doctor. The inadvisability of the union, however,
soon became apparent, and when Sir John, a little
later, asked Johnson if he would advise him to
marry, “I would advise no man to marry, sir,”
replied the great man, “who is not likely to
propagate understanding”; but the baronet, who
doubtless thought this was an excellent joke, and
as such intended, crowned his follies by espousing
a woman of more than doubtful character. When
Sir John met his future wife, she was a servant at
a house of ill-fame in Broad Street, St Giles, and,
rightly or wrongly, was credited with having been
the mistress of Jack Rann, the highwayman, better
known as “Sixteen-string Jack,” who deservedly
ended his career on the gallows in 1774. Marriage
did not apparently mend her manners or her morals,
for, according to Huish&mdash;who, it must, however,
be admitted, was an arrant scandalmonger&mdash;she
was for some time the mistress of the Duke of
York, and also acted as procuress for the Prince of
Wales; while her command of bad language was so
remarkable that the Prince used to say of any foul-mouthed
man: “He speaks like Letty Lade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p>

<p>Like her husband, Lady Lade was a fine whip,
and many stories are told of her prowess as a
driver of a four-in-hand.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lady Lade offered to drive a coach against
another tooled by a sister-whip eight miles over
Newmarket Heath for five hundred guineas a
side, but, when it came to the point, no one had
sufficient confidence to take up the wager. There
is, however, an account of another race in which
she participated: “Lady Lade and Mrs Hodges
are to have a curricle race at Newmarket, at the
next Spring Meeting, and the horses are now in
training. It is to be a five-mile course, and great
sport is expected. The construction of the traces
is to be on a plan similar to that of which Lord
March, now Marquis of Queensberry, won his
famous match against time. The odds, at present,
are in favour of Lady Lade. She runs a grey
mare, which is said to be the best horse in the
Baronet’s stalls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span></p>

<p>Like the rest of his set, Sir John spent his
patrimony and fell upon evil days, which ended,
in 1814, in imprisonment for debt in the King’s
Bench, being, as Creevey happily puts it, “reduced
to beggary by having kept such good
company.” Some arrangement was made with
his creditors, and Sir John was released; whereupon
Lord Anglesea went to the Prince of Wales,
and insisted upon his giving Lade five hundred a
year out of his Privy Purse&mdash;no easy task, one
may imagine, for “Prinney” was not given to
providing for his old friends. William IV. continued
the annuity, but reduced it to three
hundred pounds, and it was feared that at his
death it would be discontinued. However, when
the matter was put before Queen Victoria, she,
hearing that Sir John was in his eightieth year,
generously expressed the intention to pay the
pension, which she put as a charge on her Privy
Purse, for the rest of his life. Sir John was thus
freed from anxiety, but he did not long enjoy
her Majesty’s bounty, for he died on 10th
February 1838, having outlived his wife by
thirteen years.</p>

<p>A more interesting and a more intelligent man
was George Hanger, who born in 1751, and,
after attending a preparatory school, was sent to
Eton and Göttingen, and was gazetted in January<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
1771, an ensign in the first regiment of Foot
Guards. In the army he distinguished himself
chiefly by his harum-scarum mode of living, and
by his adventures, most of which were of too
delicate a nature to bear repetition, though his
quaint “Memoirs” throw a light upon the
company he kept. He met a beautiful gipsy
girl, styled by him “the lovely Ægyptea of
Norwood,” who, according to his account, had
an enchanting voice, a pretty taste for music,
and played charmingly on the dulcimer. She
won his heart with a song, the refrain of which
ran:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Tom Tinker’s my true love,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I am his dear;</span></div>
<div class="verse">And all the world over,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">His budget I’ll bear.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He married her according to the rites of the
tribe, introduced her to his brother officers, and
bragged to them of her love and fidelity; but,
alas! the song which enchanted him was based,
not upon fiction, but upon fact, and after Hanger
had lived in the tents with his inamorata for
a couple of weeks, he awoke one morning to
learn she had run off with a bandy-legged tinker.</p>

<p>For some years he remained in the Foot
Guards, where he was very popular with his
brother officers; but in 1776 he threw up his<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
commission in anger at someone being promoted
over his head, unjustly, as he thought.
His early love of soldiering, however, was not
yet abated, and he sought and obtained a captaincy
in the Hessian Jäger corps, which had
been hired by the British Government to go to
America. He was delighted with his new uniform&mdash;a
short, blue coat with gold frogs, and
a very broad sword-belt&mdash;and, thus attired,
swaggered about the town in great spirits, to
the accompaniment of his friends’ laughter.
During the siege of Charlestown he was aide-de-camp
to Sir Henry Clinton; he was wounded in
an action at Charlottetown in 1780, and two
years later was appointed Major in Tarleton’s
Light Dragoons, which regiment, however, was
disbanded in 1783, when Hanger was given the
brevet rank of Colonel, and placed on half pay.</p>

<p>At the close of the war Hanger left America
for England, but his affairs were in such an
unsettled state that he thought it advisable to
go direct to Calais, where he remained until his
friend, Richard Tattersall, could arrange his
affairs. Hanger attributed his insolvency at this
time to the fact that the lawyer to whom he
had given a power of attorney having died, his
estate was sold for the benefit of the mortgagee
at half its value. This is probably true, but it is<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
certainly only a half-truth, for his embarrassment
was mainly caused by his extravagance when he
was in the Foot Guards. He did not often play
cards, but he was passionately fond of the turf,
kept a stable at Newmarket, and bet heavily on
all occasions, though it is said that on the whole
he was a considerable winner, and it is recorded
that he won no less than seven thousand pounds
on the race between Shark and Leviathan. His
pay in the Foot Guards of four shillings a day
did not, of course, suffice even for his mess-bills,
and he wasted much money on dissipation, and
more on his clothes. “I was extremely extravagant
in my dress,” he admitted. “For one winter’s
dress-clothes only it cost me nine hundred pounds.
I was always handsomely dressed at every birthday;
but for one in particular I put myself to a
very great expense, having two suits for that day.
My morning vestments cost me near eighty
pounds, and those for the ball above one hundred
and eighty. It was a satin coat <i>brodé en plain et sur
les coutures</i>, and the first satin coat that had ever
made its appearance in this country. Shortly
after, satin dress-clothes became common among
well-dressed men.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>On his return to England, Hanger stayed with
Tattersall for a year, and then was engaged in<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
the recruiting service of the Honourable East
India Company at a salary which, with commission,
never amounted to less than six hundred
pounds a year; and he was also appointed, with a
further three hundred pounds a year, an equerry
to the Prince of Wales, with whom he was on
very intimate terms.</p>

<p>The next few years were the happiest of his
life, but misfortune soon overcame him. His employment
under the East India Company came
to an abrupt end owing to a dispute between the
Board of Control and the Company, relative to
the building of a barrack in this country to receive
the East India recruits prior to embarkation,
which ended in a change of the whole system of
recruiting, when Hanger’s services were no longer
required. This was bad enough, but worse was to
come, for when he had served as equerry for four
years, the Prince of Wales’s embarrassed affairs
were arranged by Parliament, which, making
the essential economies, dismissed Hanger.</p>

<p>When this happened, having no means whatever
with which to meet some comparatively
trifling debts, he surrendered to the Court of
King’s Bench, and was imprisoned within the
Rules from June 1798 until April in the following
year, when the successful issue of a lawsuit enabled
him to compound with his creditors. “Twice<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
have I begun the world anew; I trust the present
century will be more favourable to me than the
past,” he wrote in his “Memoirs”; and it is
much to his credit that instead of whining and
sponging on his friends, having only a capital of
forty pounds, he started in the business&mdash;he called
it the profession&mdash;of coal-merchant.</p>

<p>According to Cyrus Redding, who used to
meet him at the house of Dr Wolcot (“Peter
Pindar”), Hanger had fallen out of favour with
the Prince by administering a severe reproof to
that personage and to the Duke of York for their
use of abominable language, and was no longer
invited to Carlton House. This, however, does
not ring true, for Hanger’s language was none
of the choicest, and if there was any disagreement,
this can scarcely have been the cause.
Indeed, if at this time there was a quarrel, it
must soon have been made up; and undoubtedly
the twain were on friendly terms long after, for
when Hanger was dealing in coal, the Prince,
riding on horseback, stopped and made friendly
inquiry: “Well, George, how go coals now?”
to which Hanger, who had a pretty wit, replied
with a twinkle, “Black as ever, please your
Royal Highness.” Certainly Hanger felt no
grievance concerning the alleged quarrel, for
in his “Memoirs” he spoke in high terms of<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
the heir-apparent in a passage that deserves to
be read, as one of the few sincere tributes ever
paid to the merits of that deservedly much-abused
person.</p>

<p>Whether through the influence of the Prince
of Wales or another, Hanger was in 1806 appointed
captain commissary of the Royal Artillery
Drivers, from which he was allowed to retire on
full pay two years later, a proceeding which drew
some observations from the Commissioners of
Military Inquiry in their seventeenth report, to
which Hanger published an answer. As the years
passed, however, the free manners and the coarse
outspokenness of the Colonel jarred on the Prince,
and slowly the men drifted more and more apart,
after which the former moved in less distinguished
and probably less vicious company.</p>

<p>The first Lord Coleraine had long since been
dead; Hanger’s eldest brother, the second Baron,
had followed his father to the grave, and the title
was now enjoyed by his second brother, William,
popularly known as “Blue” Hanger, from the
colour of the clothes he wore in his youth. Charles
Marsh declared him to be “perhaps the best-dressed
man of his age,” which is an ambitious
claim for any person in the days when clothes
were more regarded in fashionable society than
anything else in the world; but that there was<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
some ground for the statement cannot be doubted,
since “Tom” Raikes reiterates it. “He was a <i>beau</i>
of the first water, always beautifully powdered, in
a light green coat, with a rose in his buttonhole.
He had not much wit or talent, but affected the
<i>vieille cour</i> and the manners of the French Court;
he had lived a good deal in Paris before the
Revolution, and used always to say that the
English were a very good nation, but they positively
knew not how to make anything but a
kitchen poker. I remember many years ago, the
Duchess of York made a party to go by water
to Richmond, in which Coleraine was included.
We all met at a given hour at Whitehall Stairs,
and found the Admiralty barge, with the Royal
Standard, ready to receive us, but by some miscalculation
of the tide, it was not possible to
embark for near half-an-hour, and one of the
watermen said to the Duchess, ‘Your Royal
Highness must wait for the tide.’ Upon which
Coleraine, with a very profound bow, remarked,
‘If I had been the tide I should have waited for
your Royal Highness.’ Nothing could have been
more stupid, but there was something in the
manner in which it was said that made everyone
burst out laughing.” “Blue” Hanger, it will be
seen, was as remarkable for his politeness as for his
satire!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span></p>

<p>Heavy losses at the card-table forced William
Hanger to go abroad to avoid his creditors, and
he remained in France until the death of his elder
brother in 1794, when, able to settle his affairs,
he returned, completely transformed in manners
and appearance into a Frenchman. Thereby hangs
the story that, shortly after he arrived in England,
he went to Drury Lane, when, next to him in the
dress circle sat a stranger wearing top-boots. This
would have been regarded as a gross breach of
etiquette in France, and Lord Coleraine was not
inclined to brook this affront to the company because
he was in England.</p>

<p>“I beg, sir, you will make no apology,” he said,
with an innocent and reassuring air.</p>

<p>His neighbour stared in blank amazement.
“Apology, sir! Apology for what?” he demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>“Why,” said “Blue,” pointing to the offending
boots, “that you did not bring your horse with
you into the box.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is lucky for you I did not bring my
<i>horsewhip</i>,” retorted the other, in a fine frenzy of
passion; “but I have a remedy at hand, and I
will pull your nose for your impertinence.”
Whereupon he threw himself upon Lord
Coleraine, only to be dragged away by persons
sitting on the other side of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span></p>

<p>Cards were exchanged between the combatants,
and a duel seemed imminent. “Blue” went at once
to his brother to beg his assistance. “I acknowledge
I was the first aggressor,” he said, in anything
but a humble frame of mind; “but it was
too bad to threaten to pull my nose. What had I
better do?” To which the unfeeling Colonel
made reply, “<i>Soap it well</i>, and then it will easily
slip through his fingers!”</p>

<p>This characteristic advice George Hanger was
never weary of repeating, and he insisted that
when anyone wished to calumniate another
gentleman, he ought to be careful to take the
precaution to <i>soap his nose</i> first. “Since I have
taken upon myself the charge of my own sacred
person,” he said, returning to the subject in his
“Memoirs,” “I never have been pulled by the
nose, or been compelled to soap it. Many gentlemen
of distinguished rank in this country are
indebted to the protecting qualities of soap for
the present enjoyment of their noses, it being as
difficult to hold a soaped nose between the fingers
as it is for a countryman, at a country wake, to
catch a pig turned out with his tail soaped and
shaved for the amusement of the spectators.”</p>

<p>“Blue” Hanger died on 11th December 1814,
when the title and estates devolved upon the
Colonel, who, however, could never be persuaded<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
to change his name. “Plain George Hanger, sir,
if you please,” he would say to those who
addressed him in the more formal manner. It
has generally been supposed that this was merely
another of the peer’s many eccentricities, but
there was a kindly reason for it. “Among the
few nobility already named,” wrote Westmacott
in the long-forgotten “Fitzalleyne of Berkeley,”
“more than one raised modest birth and merit to
their own rank; one made a marriage of reparation;
nay, even the lord rat-catcher<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> life-writer
(and it was his own), and vendor of the black
article of trade, was faithful to his engagements
where the law bound him not; and one of his
reasons for forbidding his servants to address him
as ‘My Lord’ was that she might bear his name
as Mrs Hanger.”</p>

<p>Hanger, now in the possession of a competence,
made little change in his manner of living, and
though death did not claim him until 31st March
1824, at the age of seventy-three, he never
again went into general society. At the time of
his succession to the peerage he was residing, and
during the last years of his life he continued to
reside, at Somers Town, whence he would occasionally
wander, shillelagh in hand, to the “Sol
Arms,” in Tottenham Court Road, to smoke a<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
pipe. This has been so often repeated, to the exclusion
of almost any other particulars of his life,
that the comparatively few people who have heard
of Hanger think of him as a public-house loafer;
but this was far from being the case, for if he
went sometimes to the “Sol Arms” he would
also go to Dr Wolcot to converse with the veteran
satirist, or to Nollekens, the sculptor; or he would
ride on his grey pony so far as Budd &amp; Calkin’s,
the booksellers in Pall Mall, where, leaving his
horse in charge of a boy&mdash;for he never took a
groom with him&mdash;he would sit on the counter,
talking with the shopkeepers and their customers.</p>

<p>Nor was Hanger illiterate, as were so many of
the associates of his early years, and he wrote very
readable letters; but his intelligence does not rest
only on his correspondence, for he was an industrious
writer on military subjects. Reference has
already been made to his autobiography, which
appeared in 1801 under the title of “The Life,
Adventures, and Opinions of Colonel George
Hanger”; but though it was stated on the
title-page that the volumes were “Written by
Himself,” it has since transpired that they were
compiled from his papers and suggestions by
William Combe, the author of “The Tours of
Dr Syntax.” It is an unpleasant work, and deals
frankly with subjects tacitly avoided by present-<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>day
writers; but it is not without value, for it
contains, besides excellent descriptions of debtors’
prisons and the rogueries of attorneys at the end
of the eighteenth century, common-sense views
on social subjects&mdash;views much in advance of the
general opinions of the day&mdash;and a frank avowal
of hatred of hypocrisy. This last quality induced
Hanger maliciously to relate a story of a dissenter
who kept a huxter’s shop, where a great variety
of articles were sold, and was heard to say to his
shopman, “John, have you watered the rum?”
“Yes.” “Have you sanded the brown sugar?”
“Yes.” “Have you wetted the tobacco?”
“Yes.” “Then come in to prayers.” The
“Memoirs” will perhaps best be remembered
for Hanger’s famous prophecy that “one of
these days the northern and southern Powers
[of the United States] will fight as vigorously
against each other as they have both united to
do against the British.”</p>

<p>It is, however, not as a soldier, a pamphleteer,
or a seer that Hanger has come down to posterity;
and while some may recall that in 1772 he distinguished
himself by being one of the gentlemen
who, with drawn swords, forced a passage for the
entry of Mrs Baddeley into the Pantheon, and
eight and thirty years later rode on his grey
palfrey in the procession formed in honour of the<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
release of Sir Francis Burdett, it is for his eccentricities
and his humour that he is remembered.
Nollekens has related how one day he overheard
Lord Coleraine inquire of the old apple-woman
at the corner of Portland Road, evidently an old
acquaintance, who was packing up her fruit,
“What are you about, mother?” “Why, my
Lord, I am going home to tea.” “Oh! don’t
baulk trade. Leave your things on the table as
they are; I will mind shop till you return”;
and the peer seated himself in the old woman’s
wooden chair, and waited until the meal was
over, when he solemnly handed her his takings,
threepence halfpenny.</p>

<p>Although Cyrus Redding declared that Hanger
was well known in his day for an original humour
which spared neither friend nor foe, and although
Hanger could sneer at those who accepted the
invitations to dinner that Pitt was in the habit
of sending to refractory members of his party&mdash;“The
rat-trap is set again,” he would say when
he heard of such dinner-parties: “is the bait
<i>plaice</i> or paper?”&mdash;there were many who found
themselves in a position to praise Hanger’s generosity.
We have it on the authority of Westmacott&mdash;and
there can be no surer tribute than this,
since Westmacott would far rather have said a
cruel than a kind thing&mdash;that Hanger never<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
forgot a friend or ignored an acquaintance because
he had fallen upon evil days. When an out-at-elbows
baronet came to see him, Hanger received
him heartily, insisted upon his remaining as his
guest for some time, and, summoning his servants,
addressed them characteristically: “Behold this
man, ye varlets! Never mind me while he is
here; neglect me if ye will, but look upon him
as your master; obey him in all things; the
house, the grounds, the game, the gardens, all
are at his command; let his will be done; make
him but welcome, and I care not for the rest.”
For his kind heart much may be forgiven Hanger;
and who could be angry with a man who possessed
so keen a sense of humour as is revealed
in this story? Late one night he went into his
bedroom at an inn, and found it occupied. The
opening of the door awoke an irate Irishman, the
occupier, who inquired in no measured terms:
“What the devil do you want here, sir? I shall
have satisfaction for the affront. My name is
Johnson.” Aroused by the clamour, a wizen-faced
woman by Johnson’s side raised her head from
the pillow. “Mrs Johnson, I presume?” said
Hanger dryly, bowing to the lady.</p>

<p>Sir Lumley St George Skeffington had at least
more claim to distinction than most of his brother
fops, though it was their habit to sneer at him,<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
especially after Byron had given them the cue.
Born on 23rd March 1771, Lumley was educated
at Henry Newcome’s school at Hackney,
where he showed some taste for composition and
poetry, and took part in the dramatic performances
for which that institution had been noted
for above a century. On one occasion there he
delivered an epilogue written by George Keate,
the subject of which was the folly of vanity; but
the lad did not take the lesson to heart, for so
soon as he was his own master he set up as a leader
of fashion. At an early age he began to be talked
about, and such notoriety was the <i>open sesame</i> to
Carlton House. The Prince of Wales condescended
to discuss costume with the young man, who, thus
encouraged, was spurred to fresh efforts, and acquired
fame as the inventor of a new colour, known
during his lifetime as Skeffington brown. Indeed,
Skeffington, who was vain of his personal appearance&mdash;though,
it must be confessed, without
much reason&mdash;dressed in the most foppish manner;
and as an example may be given a description of
his costume at the Court held in honour of the
King’s birthday in 1794: “A brown spotted silk
coat and breeches, with a white silk waistcoat
richly embroidered with silver, stones, and shades
of silk; the design was large baskets of silver and
stones, filled with bouquets of roses, jonquilles,<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
etc., the <i>ensemble</i> producing a beautiful and splendid
effect.”</p>

<p>Though elated at being recognised as a <i>beau</i>,
Skeffington did not desert his first love, and he
mixed much in theatrical society, and became on
intimate terms with many of the leading actors,
including Joseph Munden, John Kemble, Mrs
Siddons, and T.&nbsp;P. Cooke. He was an inveterate
“first-nighter,” and would flit from theatre to
theatre during the evening; but he was not content
to be a hanger-on to the fringe of the
dramatic profession, and desired to be a prominent
member of the <i>coterie</i>. He had abandoned any idea
of following up his youthful successes as an actor,
but he had so early as 1792, at the age of one and
twenty, made his bow as an author, with a prologue
to James Plumptre’s comedy, <i>The Coventry
Act</i>, performed at the latter’s private theatre at
Norwich.</p>

<p>Spurred by the praise bestowed upon this
trifle, he penned complimentary verses to pretty
actresses; but after a time he aspired to greater
distinction, and endeavoured to secure literary
laurels by the composition of several plays. His
<i>Word of Honour</i>, a comedy in five acts, was produced
at Covent Garden Theatre in 1802, and
in the following year his <i>High Road to Marriage</i>
was staged at Drury Lane; but neither of these<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
had any sort of success, and it was not until <i>The
Sleeping Beauty</i> was performed at Drury Lane,
in December 1805, that the author could look
upon his efforts with any pride.</p>

<p>To judge from a contemporary account,
<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>, with music by Addison,
was an agreeable, albeit an over-rated, entertainment
of the nature of an extravaganza.
“Mr Skeffington,” we are told, “has not confined
himself to the track of probability; but,
giving the rein to his imagination, has boldly
ventured into the boundless region of necromancy
and fairy adventure. The valorous days
of Chivalry are brought to our recollection,
and the tales which warmed the breasts of youth
with martial ardour are again rendered agreeable
to the mind that is not so fastidious as to turn
with fancied superiority from the pleasing delusion.
The ladies in particular would be accused of ingratitude
were they to look coldly upon the Muse
of Mr Skeffington, who had put into the mouths
of his two enamoured knights speeches and
panegyrics upon the sex, which would not discredit
the effusions of Oroondates, or any other
hero of romance.”</p>

<p>The book of the play was never printed, but
the song, duets, and choruses of this “grand
legendary melodrama” were published, and so it<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
is possible to form some opinion of the merits of
this production of the author, who is described by
a writer in <i>The Gentleman’s Magazine</i> as “the
celebrated Mr Skeffington <span class="ell">..</span>. a gentleman of
classic genius, [who] it is well known figures high
in the most fashionable circles.” It is to be feared
that Skeffington’s fame as a man of fashion threw
a glamour upon this critic, for to modern eyes the
“classic genius” is nowhere in evidence, although
the verses certainly do not compare unfavourably
with the drivel offered by the so-called lyric
writers whose effusions figure in the musical
comedies of to-day.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, however, <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>
achieved immortality, though not an immortality
of the pleasantest kind, for the piece attracted
the attention of Byron, who pilloried it in his
“English Bards and Scotch Reviewers”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse outdent">“In grim array though Lewis’ spectres rise,</div>
<div class="verse">Still Skeffington and <span class="nowrap">Goose<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> divide the prize:</div>
<div class="verse">And sure great Skeffington must claim our praise,</div>
<div class="verse">For skirtless coats and skeletons of plays,</div>
<div class="verse">Renown’d alike; whose genius ne’er confines</div>
<div class="verse">Her flight to garnish Greenwood’s gay designs;</div>

<div class="verse">Stares, wond’ring what the devil it can mean;</div>
<div class="verse">But as some hands applaud&mdash;a venal few&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Rather than sleep, John Bull applauds it too.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For years before this satire appeared Skeffington
was a personage in society, and if his plays
secured him undying notoriety at the hands of
the satirist, his costume was to produce the same
result by the attention drawn to it by Gillray,
who represented him, in 1799, as “Half Natural,”
in a Jean de Bry coat, all sleeves and padding, and
in the following year in a second caricature as
dancing, below which is the legend: “So Skiffy
skipt on, with his wonted grace.” In these days,
indeed, his appearance offered a very distinct
mark for the caricaturist. Imagine a tall, spare
man, with large features, sharp, sallow face, and
dark curly hair and whiskers, arrayed in the
glory of a dark blue coat with gilt buttons,
yellow waistcoat, with cord inexpressibles, large
bunches of white ribbons at the knees, and short
top-boots! But in latter years Skeffington went
even further, for he distinguished himself by wearing
a <i>vieux-rose</i> satin suit, and a wig, and rouging
his cheeks and blacking his eyebrows and eyelashes,
until he looked like a French doll; while
the air in his vicinity was made noxious by the
strong perfumes with which he drenched himself.<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
Horace Smith summed him up as “an admirable
specimen of the florid Gothic,” and Moore
lampooned him in Letter VIII. of <i>The Twopenny
Post Bag</i>, from “Colonel Th-m-s to
Sk-ff-ngt-n, Esq.”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Come to our <i>fête</i>, and bring with thee</div>
<div class="verse">Thy newest best embroidery,</div>
<div class="verse">Come to our <i>fête</i>, and show again</div>
<div class="verse">That pea-green coat, thou pink of men,</div>
<div class="verse">Which charmed all eyes that last surveyed it;</div>
<div class="verse">When Brummell’s self enquired: ‘Who made it?’</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">And yield in frogs and fringe to none</div>
<div class="verse">But the great Regent’s self alone.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Skeffington’s success with <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>
occurred at the time when he was most prominent
in society. “I have had a long and very
pleasant walk to-day with Mr Ilingworth in Kensington
Gardens, and saw all the extreme crowd
there about three o’clock, and between that and
four,” Lord Kenyon wrote to his wife on 1st June<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
1806. “The most conspicuous figure was Mr
Skeffington, with Miss Duncan leaning on his
arm. He is so great an author that all which is
done is thought correct, and not open to scandal.
To be sure, they looked rather a comical pair, she
with only a cap on, and he with his curious
whiskers and sharp, sallow face.”</p>

<p>Gradually, however, as time changed, Skeffington
was left behind in the race, and was no longer
regarded as a leader of fashion, and at the same
time he was not fortunate enough to win further
success as a dramatist, for his <i>Mysterious Bride</i> in
1808, his <i>Bombastes Furioso</i> played at the Haymarket
in 1810, and his <i>Lose no Time</i>, performed
three years later at Drury Lane, were each and
all dire failures.</p>

<p>In January 1815 Sir William Skeffington died,
and Lumley succeeded to the baronetcy. Sir
William, however, had embarrassed his estates,
and Lumley, to save his father from distress, had
generously consented to cut the entail, and so
had deprived himself of a considerable fortune.
The comparatively small amount of money that
now came to him had been forestalled, and he was
compelled to seek refuge for several years within
the rules of the King’s Bench Prison. Eventually,
though he failed in the attempt to regain an
interest in the estates of his maternal family, the<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
Hubbards, at Rotherhithe, he came into possession
of an estate worth about eight hundred
pounds a year; but when he came again upon
the town his old friends showed a marked disposition
to avoid him; and when one day Alvanley
was asked who was that solitary, magnificently
attired person, “It is a second edition of <i>The
Sleeping Beauty</i>,” he replied wittily; “bound in calf,
richly gilt, and illustrated by many cuts.”</p>

<p>Skeffington now resided quietly in Southwark,
where he still entertained members of the
theatrical profession, but no longer the leaders
of the calling, only the members of the adjacent
Surrey Theatre. Henry Vizetelly met him towards
the end of his life, and described him as “a quiet,
courteous, aristocratic-looking old gentleman, an
ancient fop who affected the fashions of a past
generation, and wore false hair and rouged his
cheeks,” who had, he might have added, a large
fund of <i>histoires divertissants</i> with which to regale
his visitors.</p>

<p>He outlived all his brother dandies, but to the
end would wander in the fashionable streets, recalling
the glories of his early manhood, attracting
attention in his long-waisted coat, the skirts of
which descended to his heels, but recognised by
none of the generation that had succeeded his
own. In other circles, however, he found listeners<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
interested in his stories of the palmy days of
Carlton House, when he was one of the leaders of
fashion in society and prominent in the <i>coulisses</i>.
He died, unmarried, in his eightieth year, and
attributed his long life to the fact that he did
not stir out of doors in the cold, damp winter
months, but moved from room to room so as
never to remain in vitiated air.</p>

<p>In conclusion it must be pointed out that
Skeffington’s popularity was largely contributed
to by his good humour and vivacity, and by the
fact that in an age when wit spared nobody he
was never known to say an unkind word of anyone;
nor was the reason for this, as was said of
another <i>beau</i>, that he never spoke of anyone but
himself. “As to his manners, the suffrages of the
most polished circles of this kingdom have pronounced
him one of the best bred men of the
present times, blending at once the decorum of
what is called the <i>vieille cour</i> with the careless
gracefulness of the modern school; he seems to
do everything by chance, but it is such a chance
as study could not improve,” so ran a character
sketch of the dandy in <i>The Monthly Review</i> for
1806. “In short, whenever he trifles it is with
elegance, and whenever occasion calls for energy
he is warm, spirited, animated.” He had, however,
his share of the <i>nonchalance</i> affected by the<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
fashionable folk of his day, and the story is told
that when, on a visit to a gentleman in Leicester,
he was disturbed in the night with the information
that the adjoining house was in flames, his
sole comment was that this was “a great bore”;
and when with difficulty he had been induced to
move quickly enough to escape into the street,
there, standing in his nightdress, bareheaded and
with his hair in papers, he called out, “What
are these horrid creatures about with so much
filthy water, that I cannot step without wetting
my slippers?”</p>

<h2>Some Exquisites of the
Regency</h2>


<p class="dropcap">When Almack’s Club, composed of
all the travelled young men who
wore long curls and spying-glasses,
was in 1778 absorbed by Brooks’s, the day of the
Macaronis was past. Then, as Wraxall records,
Charles James Fox and his friends, who might
be said to lead the Town, affecting a style of
neglect about their persons and manifesting a contempt
of all the usages hitherto established, first
threw a sort of discredit on dress. “Fox lodged in
St James’s Street, and as soon as he rose, which
was very late, had a <i>levée</i> of his followers and of
the members of the gambling club at Brooks’s&mdash;all
his disciples,” Walpole wrote. “His bristly
black person, and shagged breast quite open and
rarely purified by any ablutions, was wrapped in a
foul linen nightgown, and his bushy hair dishevelled.
In these cynic weeds, and with epicurean
good humour, did he dictate his politics, and in
this school did the heir of the Crown attend his
lessons and imbibe them.”</p>

<p>The young Prince of Wales might study statecraft
under Fox; but in the matter of dress he
fell in line with the new race of <i>beaux</i>, bucks, or,
to use a word that came into general use at this
time, dandies. The most famous of the latter were
Lord Petersham, Lord Foley, Lord Hertford
(immortalised by Thackeray in “Vanity Fair”<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
as the Marquis of Steyne, and by Disraeli in
“Coningsby” as Lord Monmouth), the Duke
of Argyll, Lord Worcester, Henry Pierrepoint,
Henry de Ros, Colonel Dawson Darner, Daniel
Mackinnon, Lord Dudley and Ward, Hervey
Ashton, Gronow the memoirist, Sir Lumley
Skeffington, and Brummell.</p>

<p>These exquisites were disinclined to yield the
palm even to an heir-apparent with limitless resources.
The Prince of Wales, however, contrived
to hold his own. At his first appearance in society
he created a sensation. He wore a new shoe-buckle!
This was his own invention, and differed
from all previous articles of the same kind, insomuch
as it was an inch long and five inches
broad, reaching almost to the ground on either
side of the foot! This was good for an introduction
to the polite world, but it was not
until he attended his first Court ball that he did
himself full justice. Then his magnificence was
such that the arbiters of fashion were compelled
reluctantly to admit that a powerful rival had
come upon the scene. A contemporary was so
powerfully impressed by the splendour of the
Prince’s costume that he placed on record a
description: “His coat was pink silk, with
white cuffs; his waistcoat white silk, embroidered
with various coloured foil, and adorned
<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>with a profusion of French paste; and his hat
was ornamented with two rows of steel beads,
five thousand in number, with a button and loop
of the same metal, and cocked in a new military
style.”</p>

<div><p class="tac fs120"><i>George, Prince of Wales</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The laurels won in early youth he retained all
the days of his life. Expense was no object to him,
and, indeed, it must be confessed he spent money
in many worse ways than on his clothes. Batchelor,
his valet, who entered his service after the death
of the Duke of York, said that a plain coat, from
its repeated alterations and the consequent journeys
from London to Windsor to Davison the tailor,
would often cost three hundred pounds before it
met with his approbation! George had a mania
for hoarding, and at his death all the coats, vests,
breeches, boots, and other articles of attire which
had graced his person during half-a-century were
found in his wardrobe. It is said he carried the
catalogue in his head, and could call for any
costume he had ever worn. His executors, Lord
Gifford and Sir William Knighton, discovered
in the pockets of his coats, besides innumerable
women’s love letters, locks of hair, and other
trifles of his usually discreditable amours, no less
than five hundred pocket-books, each containing
small forgotten sums of money, amounting in all
to ten thousand pounds! His clothes sold for<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
fifteen thousand pounds; they cost probably ten
times that amount.</p>

<p>Lord Petersham was a Mæcenas among the
tailors, and the inventor of an overcoat called
after him. He was famous for his brown carriages,
horses, and liveries, all of the same shade; and his
devotion to this colour was popularly supposed
to be due to the love he had borne a widow of
the name. He never went out before six o’clock
in the evening, and had many other eccentricities.
Gronow has described a visit to his apartments:
“The room into which we were ushered was
more like a shop than a gentleman’s sitting-room.
All around the wall were shelves, upon which
were placed the canisters containing congou,
pekoe, souchong, bohea, gunpowder, Russian,
and many other teas, all the best of their kind;
on the other side of the room were beautiful
jars, with names in gilt letters of innumerable
kinds of snuff, and all the necessary apparatus
for moistening and mixing. Lord Petersham’s
mixture is still well known to all tobacconists.
Other shelves and many of the tables were
covered with a great number of magnificent
snuff-boxes; for Lord Petersham had perhaps
the finest collection in England, and was supposed
to have a fresh box for every day in the
year. I heard him, on the occasion of a delight<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>ful
old light-blue Sèvres box he was using being
admired, say in his lisping way, ‘Yes, it is a nice
summer box, but it would not do for winter
wear.’&#8239;” Queen Charlotte had made snuff-taking
fashionable in England, but the habit began to
die out with the Regency. George IV. carried a
box, but he had no liking for it; and, conveying
it with a grand air between his right thumb and
forefinger, he was careful to drop it before it
reached his nose. He gave up the custom of
offering a pinch to his neighbours, and it was
recognised as a breach of good manners to dip
uninvited into a man’s box. When at the Pavilion
the Bishop of Winchester committed such an
infringement of etiquette, Brummell told a servant
to throw the rest of the snuff into the fire. When
Lord Petersham died, his snuff was sold by auction.
It took three men three days to weigh it, and
realised three thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Another eccentric was Lord Dudley and Ward,
sometime Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
who eventually lost his reason. His absence of
mind was notorious, and he had a habit of talking
aloud that frequently landed him in trouble.
Dining at the house of a <i>gourmet</i>, under the impression
he was at home, he apologised for the
badness of the <i>entrées</i>, and begged the company
to excuse them on account of the illness of his<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
cook! Similarly, when he was paying a visit he
imagined himself to be the entertainer, and when
his hostess had exhausted her hints concerning
the duration of his call, he murmured, “A very
pretty woman. But she stays a devilish long time.
I wish she’d go.” Still more amusing were his
remarks in the carriage of a brother peer who
had volunteered to drive him from the House of
Lords to Dudley House: “A deuce of a bore!
This tiresome man has taken me home, and will
expect me to ask him to dinner. I suppose I must
do so, but it is a horrid nuisance.” This was too
much for his good-natured companion, who, as
if to himself, droned in the same monotonous
tones, “What a bore! This good-natured fellow
Dudley will think himself obliged to invite me
to dinner, and I shall be forced to go. I hope he
won’t ask me, for he gives d&mdash;&mdash;d bad dinners.”
These stories recall another related of an absent-minded
royal duke, who, when during the
service the parson proposed the prayer for rain,
said in a voice audible throughout the church,
“Yes, by all means let us pray, but it won’t be
any good. We sha’n’t get rain till the moon
changes.”</p>

<p>After Brummell left England, it was to William,
Lord Alvanley that all the witty sayings of the
day were attributed. The son of the famous<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
lawyer Sir Pepper Arden<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> he began life in the
Coldstream Guards, of which the colonel was
the Duke of York. He achieved his earliest
success as a wit at the expense of a brother
officer, Gunter, a scion of the famous catering-house.
Gunter’s horse was almost beyond the
control of the rider, who explained that his
horse was too hot to hold. “Ice him, Gunter;
ice him,” cried Alvanley. Thrown into such
company, it was not perhaps unnatural that
Alvanley should be extravagant; but his carelessness
in money matters was notorious. He
never paid ready money for anything, and
never knew the extent of his indebtedness. He
had no sympathy with those who devoted some
time and trouble to the management of their
affairs, and expressed the utmost contempt for a
friend who was so weak as to “muddle away his
fortune paying tradesmen’s bills.” Though very
wealthy, he soon became embarrassed in his
circumstances. He persuaded Charles Greville,
the author of the “Journals,” to put his affairs
in order. The two men spent a day over accounts,<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
and Greville found that the task he had undertaken
would not be so difficult as he had been
given to understand. His relief was not long-lived,
however, for on the following morning he
received a note from Alvanley saying he had
quite forgotten a debt of fifty thousand pounds!</p>

<p>Alvanley was famous for his dinners, and indulged
in the expensive taste of having an apricot
tart on his table every day throughout the year.
His dinners were generally acclaimed as the best
in England; certainly he spared no expense in
the endeavour to secure the blue ribbon of the
table. Even Abraham Hayward commented on
his extravagance. “He had his <i>suprême de
volaille</i> made of the oysters, or <i>les sots, les-laissent</i>
of fowls, instead of the fillet from the breast,”
he noted in “The Art of Dining,” “so that it
took a score of birds to complete a moderate
dish.” It was Alvanley who organised a
wonderful freak dinner at White’s Club, at
which the inventor of the most costly dish
should dine at the cost of the others; and he
won easily. His contribution to the feast was
a <i>fricassée</i> made of the <i>noix</i>, or small pieces at
each side of the back, taken from thirteen
different kinds of birds, among them being
a hundred snipe, forty woodcocks, twenty
pheasants&mdash;in all some three hundred birds.<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
The cost of this dish exceeded one hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>As he was beloved by his friends and vastly
popular, society was enraged when O’Connell in
the House of Commons spoke of him as “a
bloated buffoon.” A challenge was sent at once,
but the Liberator refused to go out. He had been
on the ground once, had killed his man, and had
vowed never to fight another duel. Alvanley would
not forgive the insult, however, and threatened
to thrash the aggressor; whereupon Morgan
O’Connell met him in place of his father, when
several shots were exchanged without result.
“What a clumsy fellow O’Connell must be, to
miss such a fat fellow as I!” said Alvanley
calmly. “He ought to practise at a haystack to
get his hand in.” Driven back to London, he
gave the hackney-coachman a sovereign. “It’s a
great deal,” said the man gratefully, “for having
taken your lordship to Wimbledon.” “No, my
good fellow,” the peer laughed; “I give it you,
not for taking me, but for bringing me back.”</p>

<p>Beyond all question the greatest dandy of his
day was George Bryan Brummell, generally
called Beau Brummell. This famous personage
dominated all his rivals, and even the Prince of
Wales accepted him at least as an equal. It is
not known with any certainty how his acquaint<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>ance
began with the heir-apparent. Brummell’s
aunt, Mrs Searle, who had a little cottage with
stables for cows at the entrance, opposite Clarges
Street, of the Green Park, in which she had been
installed by George III., related that it was one
day when the Prince of Wales, accompanied by
the beautiful Marchioness of Salisbury, stopped
to see the cows milked that he first met her
nephew, was attracted by him, and, hearing he
was intended for the army, offered him a commission
in his own regiment. Gronow gives
another story, which on the face of it is more
probable. Brummell made many friends among
the scions of good family while he was at Eton,
where he seems to have been regarded as an
Admirable Crichton: “the best scholar, the best
boatman, the best cricketer.” He was invited to
a ball at Devonshire House, became a great
favourite, and was asked everywhere. The Prince
sent for him, and, pleased by his manner and
appearance, gave him a commission. In his seventeenth
year he was gazetted to a cornetcy in the
Tenth Light Dragoons. He resigned soon after
because the regiment was ordered to Manchester<span class="nowrap">!<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span></p>

<p>Brummell threw himself heart and soul into the<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
social life of the metropolis, and soon his reputation
extended far and wide, until no party was complete
without him, and his presence was regarded
as the hall-mark of fashion. He was the very man
for the part he had set himself. Tall, well made,
with a good figure, he affected an old-world air
of courtesy, picked up probably from the French
refugees, as he had never been out of England
until he left it for good. His affectation of <i>vieille
cour</i> showed itself in the use of powder, which
distinguished him in the days when the custom
was dying out among civilians. His grandfather
was a tradesman, and let lodgings in Bury Street,
St James’s. His father, by the influence of a lodger,
was presented to a clerkship in the Treasury,
became private secretary to Lord North, made
money by speculation, settled down at Donnington,
and became High Sheriff of Berkshire,
where he was visited by Fox and Sheridan.
Though of no rank, Brummell lived with the
highest in the land on terms of equality. His
acquaintance was sought, his intimacy desired;
and, so far from requiring a patron, it was he
who patronised. His influence was unbounded,
his fascination undeniable, his indifference to
public opinion reckless. He was good-natured
and rarely out of humour; neither a drunkard
nor a profligate. He had bright and amusing con<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>versation,
some wit, and a considerable power of
<i>persiflage</i>, which, while it enabled him to laugh
some people out of bad habits, only too frequently
was exerted to laugh others out of good principles.</p>

<p>He revived the taste for dress. “Clean linen, and
plenty of it” was an important item of his creed.
His great triumph was in connection with the
cravat. Before he came into his own they were
worn without stiffening of any kind; as soon as
he ascended his throne he had them starched<span class="nowrap">!<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>
A revolution would not have attracted more attention.
Thereafter his sway was undisputed, and his
word law in all matters of fashion. The Prince of
Wales used to call on him in the morning at his
house in Chesterfield Street, and, deeply engrossed
in the discussion of costume, would frequently remain
to dinner. “Brummell was always studiously
and remarkably well dressed, never <i>outré</i>; and,
though considerable time and attention were devoted
to his toilet, it never, when once accomplished,
seemed to occupy his attention,” said one
who knew him well. “His manners were easy,
polished, and gentleman-like, and regulated by
that same good taste which he displayed in most<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
things. No one was a more keen observer of vulgarity
in others, or more <i>piquant</i> in his criticisms,
or more despotic as an <i>arbiter elegantarium</i>; he
could decide the fate of a young man just launched
into the world with a single word.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span></p>

<p>The tastes of the Prince of Wales verged on the
florid, but Brummell’s efforts tended to simplicity
of costume. Under Brummell the dandy’s dress
consisted of a blue coat with brass buttons, leather
breeches, and top-boots; with, of course, the deep,
stiff white cravat which prevented you from seeing
your boots while standing. Gronow relates
that while he was in Paris after Waterloo trousers
and shoes were worn by young men, only old
fogies favouring knee-breeches. On his return to
England in 1816, receiving from Lady Hertford
an invitation to Manchester House “to have the
honour of meeting the Prince Regent,” he went
dressed <i>à la Française</i>&mdash;white neckcloth, waistcoat,
black trousers, shoes and silk stockings. He
made his bow, and almost immediately afterwards
Horace Seymour came to him: “The great man
is very much surprised that you should have ventured
to appear in his presence without knee-breeches.
He considers it as a want of proper<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
respect for him.” Gronow went away in high
dudgeon. A month later the Prince adopted the
dress he had censured!</p>

<p>All the world watched Brummell to imitate
him. He made the fortune of his tailor, Weston,
of Old Bond Street, and of his other tradesmen.
The most noteworthy of these was Hoby, the St
James’s Street bootmaker, an impertinent and
independent man who employed his leisure as a
Methodist preacher. Many good stories are told
of him. It was he who said to the Duke of Kent,
when the latter informed him of the issue of the
great battle at Vittoria, “If Lord Wellington had
had any other bootmaker than myself he would
never have had his great and constant successes,
for my boots and my prayers bring him out of all
his difficulties.” When Horace Churchill entered
his shop and complained in no moderate words of
a pair of boots, vowing he would never employ him
again, Hoby quickly turned the tables. “John,
close the shutters,” he cried to an assistant, affecting
a woebegone look. “It is all over with us. I
must shut up shop. Ensign Churchill withdraws
his custom from me.” Sir John Shelley once
showed him a pair of top-boots that had split in
several places. “How did that happen, Sir John?”
“Why, in walking to my stable,” the customer
explained. “Walking to your stable!” Hoby ex<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>claimed,
not troubling to suppress a sneer. “I
made the boots for riding, not walking.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<p>It is but a step from boots to blacking, an
article to which the dandies devoted much attention.
Lieutenant-Colonel Kelly, of the First Foot
Guards, was famous for his well-varnished boots.
After his death, which occurred in a fire owing to
his efforts to save his favourite boots, all the men
about town were anxious to secure the services of
his valet, who alone knew the secret of the blacking.
Brummell found the man and asked his wages.
The Colonel had given him a hundred and fifty
pounds a year, but now he required two hundred.
“Well, if you will make it guineas,” said the Beau,
“<i>I</i> shall be happy to attend upon <i>you</i>!” Lord
Petersham spent a great deal of time in making
a particular kind of blacking which he believed
would eventually supersede all others, and Brummell
declared, “My blacking ruins me; it is made
with the finest champagne.” But Brummell must
not be taken too seriously. He was a master <i>poseur</i>,
and many of his critics have fallen into the error
of taking him literally. Thus it has apparently
never occurred to his biographers to think he was
joking when, in reply to a lady who inquired what
allowance she should make her son who was about<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
to enter the world, he assured her that, <i>with
economy</i>, her son could dress on eight hundred a
year. They merely comment upon his terribly
extravagant ideas. Again, when the Beau, speaking
of a boy, said with apparent earnestness,
“Really, I did my best for the young man; I
once gave him my arm all the way from White’s
to Watier’s”&mdash;about a hundred yards&mdash;they discuss
his enormous conceit!</p>

<p>There are several accounts of the cause of the
rupture of the intimacy between Brummell and
the Prince. It is certain, however, that the story
of “Wales, ring the bell,” has no foundation. “I
was on such intimate terms with the Prince that
if we had been alone I could have asked him without
offence to ring the bell,” Brummell said; “but
with a third person in the room I should never
have done so. I knew the Regent too well.” The
story was true in so far as the order, “Wales,
ring the bell,” was given at the royal supper-table
by a lad who had taken too much to drink. The
Prince did ring the bell, and when the servants
came, told them, good-humouredly enough, to
“put that drunken boy to bed.” One authority
says the quarrel arose because Brummell spoke
sarcastically of Mrs Fitzherbert, another because
he spoke in her favour when the Prince was bestowing
his smiles in another quarter. The Beau<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
believed it was because of remarks concerning both
Mrs Fitzherbert and the Prince. There is no doubt
Brummell did allow himself considerable licence
of speech, and having a ready wit, was not inclined
to forego its use.</p>

<p>A curious tale was told by General Sir Arthur
Upton to Gronow. It seems that the first estrangement
did not last long. Brummell played whist at
White’s Club one night, and won from George
Harley <span class="nowrap">Drummond<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> the sum of twenty thousand
pounds. The Duke of York told the Prince of the
incident, and the Beau was again invited to Carlton
House. “At the commencement of the dinner
matters went off smoothly; but Brummell, in his
joy at finding himself with his old friend, became
excited, and drank too much wine. His Royal
Highness&mdash;who wanted to avenge himself for an
insult he had received at Lady Cholmondeley’s
ball, when the Beau, looking towards the Prince,
said to Lady Worcester, ‘Who is your fat friend?’&mdash;had
invited him to dinner merely out of a desire
for revenge. The Prince, therefore, pretended to
be affronted with Brummell’s hilarity, and said to
his brother, the Duke of York, who was present,
‘I think we had better order Mr Brummell’s<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
carriage before he gets drunk’; whereupon he
rang the bell, and Brummell left the royal
presence.” As Sir Arthur was present at the dinner,
there can be no doubt as to the facts; and, knowing
the character of the royal host as we do, there
is no reason to doubt that he invited a guest to
insult him. That is quite of a piece with his conduct
on other occasions; but it seems certain that
the motive that spurred the Prince on to revenge
was not that attributed to him. Of all the versions
of the “Who’s your fat friend?” episode, that
given by the General is the least likely. Inaccurate,
too, is Raikes when he tells of Brummell
asking the famous question of Jack Lee in St
James’s Street, after the latter had been seen speaking
to the Prince.</p>

<p>The true story is the following: A dandies’
ball was to be given by Lord Alvanley, Sir Henry
Mildmay, Henry Pierrepoint and Brummell to
celebrate a great run of luck at hazard. The question
of inviting the Prince was mooted, but it was
negatived because all felt sure it would be declined,
since he was not on friendly terms with Brummell.
The Prince, however, sent an intimation that he
desired to be present, and of course a formal invitation
was despatched. The four hosts assembled
at the door to do honour to their royal guest,
who shook hands with three of them, but looked<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
Brummell full in the face and passed on without
any sign of recognition. Then it was, before the
Prince was out of hearing, that Brummell turned
to his neighbour and asked with apparent nonchalance,
“Alvanley, who’s your fat friend?”</p>

<p>After this there was war to the death, and
Brummell, who was a good fighter, did not miss
any opportunity to wound his powerful antagonist.
He was passing down Pall Mall when the Regent’s
carriage drew up at a picture gallery. The sentries
saluted, and, keeping his back to the carriage,
Brummell took the salute as if to himself. The
Prince could not hide his anger from the bystanders,
for he looked upon any slight to his dignity as
rather worse than high treason. The foes met
again later on in the waiting-room at the opera.
An eye-witness has described the <i>rencontre</i>: “The
Prince of Wales, who always came out rather before
the performance concluded, was waiting for
his carriage. Presently Brummell came out, talking
eagerly to some friends, and, not seeing the
Prince or his party, he took up a position near the
checktaker’s bar. As the crowd flowed out, Brummell
was gradually pressed backwards, until he was
all but driven against the Regent, who distinctly
saw him, but of course would not move. In order
to stop him, therefore, and prevent actual collision,
one of the Prince’s suite tapped him on the<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
back, when Brummell immediately turned sharply
round, and saw there was not much more than a
foot between his nose and the Prince of Wales’s.
I watched him with intense curiosity, and observed
that his countenance did not change in the slightest
degree, nor did his head move; they looked straight
into each other’s eyes, the Prince evidently amazed
and annoyed. Brummell, however, did not quail,
or show the least embarrassment. He receded
quite quietly, and backed slowly step by step
till the crowd closed between them, never once
taking his eyes off those of the Prince.” Moore,
in the <i>Twopenny Post Bag</i>, commemorated the
quarrel in his parody of the letter from the
Prince of Wales to the Duke of York, in which
he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“I indulge in no hatred, and wish there may come ill</div>
<div class="verse">To no mortal, except, now I think on’t, Beau Brummell,</div>
<div class="verse">Who declared t’other day, in a superfine passion,</div>
<div class="verse">He’d cut me and bring the old King into fashion.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Brummell contrived to hold his own until he
took to card-playing. His patrimony of thirty
thousand pounds was insufficient to justify him in
entering the lists with his companions. It was the
case of the earthenware pot and the iron pots. At
first he was unsuccessful, and as he was not then
addicted to games of chance, his depression was<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
very great. Walking home from a club with Tom
Raikes, he was lamenting his bad fortune, when
he saw something bright in the roadway. He
stooped and picked up a crooked sixpence. “This,”
he said to his companion with great cheerfulness,
“is the harbinger of good luck.” He drilled a hole
in it and fastened it to his watch-chain. The talisman
worked, and he won thirty thousand pounds
in the next two years.</p>

<p>Fortune deserted him; but he did not lose
even a third of his winnings, and Raikes, in his
“Memoirs,” remarks that he was never more
surprised than when in 1816, one morning, Brummell
confided to him that his situation had become
so desperate that he must fly the country that night,
and by stealth. He had lived above his income,
had got into debt, and then had fallen into the
hands of the notorious usurers, Howard and Gibbs.
Other money-lenders may have had claims upon
him; for when it was said to Alvanley that if
Brummell had remained in London something
might have been done for him by his friends, the
witty peer made a <i>bon mot</i>: “He has done quite
right to be off; it was Solomon’s judgment.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span></p>

<p>He went no farther than Calais. “Here I am
<i>restant</i> for the present, and God knows solitary
enough is my existence; of that, however, I should<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
not complain, for I can always employ resources
within myself, was there not a worm that will not
sleep, called <i>conscience</i>, which all my endeavours to
distract, all the strength of coffee, with which I
constantly fumigate my unhappy brains, and all
the native gaiety of the fellow who brings it to me,
cannot lull to indifference beyond the moment;
but I will not trouble you upon that subject.”
He wrote to Tom Raikes on 22nd May 1816, soon
after his arrival: “You would be surprised to find
the sudden change and transfiguration which one
week has accomplished in my life and <i>propriâ
personâ</i>. I am punctually off the pillow at half-past
seven in the morning. My first object&mdash;melancholy,
indeed, it may be in its nature&mdash;is
to walk to the pier-head, and take my distant look
at England. This you may call weakness; but I
am not yet sufficiently master of those feelings
which may be called indigenous to resist the
impulse. The rest of my day is filled up with
strolling an hour or two round the ramparts of
this dismal town, in reading, and the study of that
language which must hereafter be my own, for
never more shall I set foot in my own country. I
dine at five, and my evening has as yet been
occupied in writing letters. The English I have
seen here&mdash;and many of them known to me&mdash;I
have cautiously avoided; and with the exception<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
of Sir W. Bellingham and Lord Blessington, who
have departed, I have not exchanged a word.
Prince Esterhazy was here yesterday, and came
into my room unexpectedly without my knowing
he was here. He had the good nature to convey
several letters for me upon his return to London.
So much for my life hitherto on this side of the
water.”</p>

<p>At first he put up at the famous Dessein’s, but
soon he went into apartments at the house of
M. Leleux. His friends came to the rescue&mdash;Alvanley,
Worcester, Sefton, no doubt Raikes
too, and others&mdash;and sent him a good round sum
of money. But his habits had grown upon him,
and he could not live economically. If he saw
buhl or marqueterie or Sèvres china that he liked
he bought it; and he could not accustom himself
to the penny-wise economies of life. He would not
give way to despair, and, naturally high-spirited,
he fought bravely against depression. He wished
to be appointed consul at Calais, and his friends’
influence would have secured him the position,
but no vacancy occurred.</p>

<p>He had a gleam of hope on hearing of the accession
to the throne of his old companion. “He is
at length King,” he wrote; “will his past resentments
still attach themselves to his Crown? An
indulgent amnesty of former peccadilloes should<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
be the primary grace influencing newly throned
sovereignty; at least towards those who were once
distinguished by his more intimate protection.
From my experience, however, of the personage
in question, I must doubt any favourable relaxation
of those stubborn prejudices which have,
during so many years, operated to the total exclusion
of one of his <i>élèves</i> from the royal notice:
that unfortunate&mdash;I need not particularise. You
ask me how I am going on at Calais. Miserably!
I am exposed every hour to all the turmoil and
jeopardy that attended my latter days in England.
I bear up as well as I can; and when the mercy
and patience of my claimants are exhausted I
shall submit without resistance to bread and water
and straw. I cannot decamp a second time.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span></p>

<p>The new King made no sign. But soon came
the news that he was going abroad, and would
stay a night at Calais. The pulse of the exiled
dandy must have beat quickly. It was the time
for forgiveness; and, after all, his offence had
not been very rank. If there were generosity in
the heart of the monarch, surely, surely he would<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
hold out the right hand of fellowship to the
vanquished foe. The meeting came about unexpectedly.
Brummell went for a walk out of the
town in the opposite direction to that on which
the King would enter it. On his return he tried
to get across the street, but the crowd was so
great that he remained perforce on the opposite
side. The King’s carriage passed close to him.
“Good God, Brummell!” George cried in a loud
voice. Then Brummell, who was hat in hand
at the time, crossed the road, pale as death, and
entered his room.</p>

<p>George dined in the evening at Dessein’s, and
Brummell sent his valet to make the punch, giving
him to take over a bottle of rare old maraschino,
the King’s favourite liqueur. The next morning
all the suite called except Bloomfield, and each
man tried to persuade him to ask for an audience.
Brummell signed his name in the visitors’ book.
His pride would let him do no more. He had
taken the first steps; would the King send for
him? George left without a word. Afterwards he
actually boasted he had been to Calais without
seeing Brummell! So the men went their ways,
never to meet again. The King had won. He had
seen his old friend, his old foe&mdash;which you will&mdash;his
old comrade, beaten, bankrupt, humbled,
and he had passed him by. The King had won,<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
yet perhaps for once it was better to be the vanquished
than to win at such a price. Perhaps in
the last years of his life George thought once more
of Brummell, as himself half blind, half mad,
utterly friendless, he went down to the grave unwept
and unhonoured.</p>

<p>Others were more generous than the King.
The Duke of Wellington invited two successive
Ministers for Foreign Affairs to do something for
the exile. Both hesitated on the ground that his
Majesty might disapprove, whereupon Wellington
went to Windsor and spoke to the King, “who
had made objections, abusing Brummell&mdash;said he
was a damned fellow and had behaved very ill to
him (the old story&mdash;<i>moi</i>, <i>moi</i>, <i>moi</i>); but after having
let him run his tether, he had at last extracted
his consent.” Still, nothing was done until after
Charles Greville was at Calais in 1830: “There
I had a long conversation with Brummell about
his consulship, and was moved by his account of
his own distresses to write to the Duke of Wellington
and ask him to do what he could for him.
I found him in his old lodging, dressing&mdash;some
pretty pieces of old furniture in the room, an
entire toilet of silver, and a large green macaw
perched on the back of a tattered silk chair with
faded gilding&mdash;full of gaiety, impudence, and
misery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span></p>

<p>The consulate at Caen, to which a salary of
four hundred a year was attached, was secured for
him. Brummell arranged that part of his income
should be set aside to pay his debts (which
amounted to about a thousand pounds), and his
creditors allowed him to leave Calais. He had
not long been installed when he wrote a formal
letter to Lord Palmerston, then Foreign Secretary,
stating that the place was a sinecure and the duties
so trifling that he should recommend its abolition.
It has never been made clear why he took this
remarkable step. Was it in the hope of being
appointed to a better position? Was it in the
desire to evade the payment of his debts? Was
it honesty? Whatever the cause, his action recoiled
on himself. Lord Palmerston was regretfully
compelled to take the consul at his word,
and the place was reduced.</p>

<p>Brummell continued to live at Caen; but, being
without resources, he sank deeper into debt, and
in 1835 his creditors put him into prison. For the
last time his friends came to his assistance. William
<span class="lowercase smcap">IV.</span> subscribed a hundred pounds. Palmerston
gave twice that amount from the public purse.
Enough was obtained to secure his liberation and
to settle upon him an annuity of one hundred
and twenty pounds. Soon he sank into a state
of imbecility, and he ended his days in the<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
asylum Bon Sauveur. He died on 30th March
1840.</p>

<p>A moral can easily be drawn from the story of
this unfortunate man, and many writers have
dwelt upon the lesson it furnishes. Yet there
were many worse than he in the circle of which
he was the arbiter. He lived his life: he paid the
price. Let him rest in peace.</p>

<p>With the departure from England of Brummell
the cult of the dandy began to decline.
Count D’Orsay the Magnificent, however, galvanised
it into fashion for a while. “He is a grand
creature,” Gronow described him; “beautiful as
the Apollo Belvedere in his outward form; full
of health, life, spirits, wit, and gaiety; radiant
and joyous; the admired of all admirers.”</p>

<p>He had an amusing <i>naïveté</i> in speaking of his
personal advantages. “You know, my dear friend,
I am not on a par with my antagonist,” he said
to his second on the eve of a duel. “He is a very
ugly man, and if I wound him in the face he
won’t look much the worse for it; but on my
side it ought to be agreed that he shall not aim
higher than my chest, for if my face should be
spoiled <i>ce serait vraiment dommage</i>.”</p>

<p>The dandies of a later day were but poor things&mdash;pinchbeck.
Captain Gronow, in his youth a
<i>beau</i> of no mean order, pours contempt upon<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
their pretensions in no measured terms. “How
unspeakably odious&mdash;with a few brilliant exceptions,
such as Alvanley and others&mdash;were the
dandies of forty years ago [1822]! They were
generally middle-aged, some even elderly, men,
had large appetites and weak digestions, gambled
freely, and had no luck. They hated everybody
and abused everybody, and would sit together in
White’s bay window or the pit-boxes at the opera
weaving tremendous crammers. They swore a
good deal, never laughed, had their own particular
slang, looked hazy after dinner, and had most of
them been patronised at one time or other by
Brummell and the Prince Regent<span class="ell">...</span>. They
gloried in their shame, and believed in nothing
good or noble or elevated. Thank Heaven, that
miserable race of used-up dandies has long been
extinct! May England never look upon their like
again!”</p>

<p>The prayer may well be echoed. The bad influence
of the dandies can scarcely be over-estimated;
and the effect upon their own class of society was
terrible. Their morals were contemptible, and
they were without principle. Prodigality was their
creed, gambling their religion. The list of those
who died beggared is not much longer than the
list of those who died by their own hands. They
indulged in no manly exercises, and devoted their<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
days to their personal decoration and to the card-table.
Extravagance of all kinds was fashionable.
Clothes, canes, snuff-boxes, must be expensive to
be worthy of such distinguished folk, whose sole
aim it was to outvie each other. A guinea was
the least that could be given to the butler when
dining out; but this was an improvement upon
the day when Pope, finding it cost him five
guineas in tips whenever he dined with the
Duke of Montagu, informed that nobleman he
could not dine with him in future unless he sent
him an order for the tribute-money.</p>

<p>There was Wellesley Pole, who, after the opera,
gave magnificent dinners at his home at Wanstead,
where rare dishes were served and the greatest
luxury obtained. He married Miss Tylney Pole,
who brought him fifty thousand a year; and
he died a beggar. There was “Golden Ball”
Hughes, with forty thousand a year, who, when
the excitements of the gaming-room were not
to be had, would play battledore and shuttlecock
through the whole night, backing himself
for immense sums. He married a beautiful
Spanish <i>danseuse</i>, Mercandotti, who appeared in
London in 1822. Whereupon Ainsworth made
an epigram:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“The fair damsel is gone, and no wonder at all</div>
<div class="verse">That, bred to the dance, she is gone to a Ball.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span></p>

<p>The honeymoon was spent at Oatlands, purchased
from the Duke of York. It was thought to be a
foolish investment; but when Hughes fell upon
evil days he was able to sell the estate for a
large sum, as the new railway skirted it, and
speculative builders were anxious to acquire the
land, and so some of his old prosperity returned.
There was Lord Fife, an intimate friend of the
Regent’s, who spent forty thousand pounds on
Mademoiselle Noblet the dancer. A chapter
would not suffice for an account of the vicious
and foolish habits of these men.</p>

<p>The clubs were then a far more important
feature in social life than they are to-day. They
were accessible only to those who were in society,
which in those days was exclusive, and consisted
of a comparatively small body in which everyone
knew everyone else, if not personally, at
least by name. There were then no clubs for
professional men save those of the first rank, or
for merchants, or for the <i>hoi polloi</i>.</p>

<p>In more or less direct rivalry with the clubs
were some of the hotels, and men such as Wellington,
Nelson, Collingwood and Sir John Moore
used them as a meeting-place&mdash;at the beginning
of the eighteenth century about fifteen in number,
not including, of course, the large coaching inns,
coffee, eating, and the <i>à la mode</i> beef houses, most<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
of which had beds for customers. First and foremost
of these, kept by a French <i>chef</i>, Jacquiers,
who had served Louis XVIII. and Lord Darnley,
was the Clarendon, built upon a portion of the
gardens of Clarendon House, between Bond Street
and Albemarle Street, in each of which the hotel
had a frontage. This was the only place in England
where a French dinner was served that was worthy
of mention in the same breath with those obtainable
in Paris at the Maison Doré or Rocher de
Cancalle’s. The prices were very high. Dinner
cost three or four pounds a head, and a bottle of
claret or champagne was not obtainable under a
guinea. A suite of apartments was reserved for
banquets, and it was in these that the famous
dinner, ordered by Count D’Orsay, was given to
Lord Chesterfield when he resigned the office of
Master of the Buckhounds. Covers were laid for
thirty, and the bill, exclusive of wine, came to
one hundred and eighty guineas.</p>

<p>Limmer’s was another well-known hotel, the
resort of the sporting world and of rich country
squires. It was gloomy and ill-kept, but renowned
for its plain English cooking and world-famous
for gin-punch. The clergy went to Ibbetson’s,
naval men to Fladong’s in Oxford Street, and
army officers and men about town to Stephen’s
in Bond Street. Most of these hostelries had their<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
regular frequenters, and strangers were not, as a
rule, encouraged to use them as a house of call.</p>

<p>Clubs were few in number. There was “The
Club” of Johnson; the Cocoa-Tree, which arose
out of the Tory Chocolate House of Anne’s reign;
the Royal Naval Club, a favourite haunt of the
Duke of Clarence; and the Eccentrics, which
numbered among its members such well-known
men as Fox, Sheridan, Lord Petersham, Brougham,
Lord Melbourne, and Theodore Hook. Graham’s
was second rate; nor was Arthur’s in the first
flight. When Arthur died, his son-in-law,
Mackreth, became the proprietor. He prospered,
became a member of Parliament in 1774, and
was afterwards knighted. His name is preserved
in a very good epigram:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“When Mackreth served in Arthur’s crew,</div>
<div class="verse">He said to Rumbold, ‘Black my shoe’;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To which he answered, ‘Ay, Bob.’</div>
<div class="verse">But when return’d from India’s land,</div>
<div class="verse">And grown too proud to brook command,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He sternly answered, ‘Nay, Bob.’<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An institution of a somewhat different class
was the Beefsteak Society, which flourished so<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
long ago as the early years of the eighteenth
century. The Prince of Wales became a member
in 1785, when the number of the Steaks was increased
from twenty-four to twenty-five in order
to admit him; and subsequently the Dukes of
Clarence and Sussex were elected. The bill of
fare was restricted to beefsteaks, and the beverages
to port wine and punch; but the cuisine on at
least one occasion left something to be desired,
for when, in 1830, the English Opera House
was burnt down, Greville remarked in his diary:
“I trust the paraphernalia of the Beefsteak Club
perished with the rest, for the enmity I bear that
society for the dinner they gave me last year.”
Charles Morris was the bard of the Beefsteak
Society, and he has come down to posterity on
the strength of four lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“In town let me live then, in town let me die,</div>
<div class="verse">For in truth I can’t relish the country, not I.</div>
<div class="verse">If one must have a villa in summer to dwell,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, give me the sweet, shady side of Pall Mall!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In spite of his prayer, he spent the last years of
his life in the rural retreat of Brockham, in
Surrey, in a little place presented to him by his
fellow-Steak, the Duke of Norfolk. He lived to
the great age of ninety-two, and was so hale and
hearty and cheerful that, not long before his<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
death, Curran said to him, “Die when you will,
Charles, you will die in your youth.”</p>

</div>

<p>The greatest club of its day was Almack’s, at
5 Pall Mall, founded in 1740 by Macall, a Scotsman.
This institution was nicknamed the “Macaroni
Club,” owing to the fashion of its members;
and Gibbon remarked that “the style of living,
though somewhat expensive, is exceedingly pleasant,
and notwithstanding the rage of play, I have
found more entertainment and rational society
here than in any other club to which I belong.”
The high play, which was the bane of half the
English aristocracy, ruined many members. The
club fell upon evil days, and was absorbed by
Brooks’s.</p>

<p>White’s and Brooks’s took the place of Almack’s.
The former, established in 1698 as
“White’s Chocolate-House,” five doors from the
bottom of the west side of St James’s Street,
became a club in 1755, when it moved to No.
38, on the opposite side of the street. It was
owned successively by Arthur Mackreth, John
Martindale, and in 1812 by Raggett, whose son
eventually inherited it. Brooks’s was founded by
a wine merchant and money-lender of the name,
who has been described by Tickell in verses
addressed to Sheridan, when Charles James Fox
was to give a supper at his rooms near the club:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Derby shall send, if not his plate, his cooks;</div>
<div class="verse">And know, I’ve bought the best champagne from Brooks,</div>
<div class="verse">From liberal Brooks, whose speculative skill</div>
<div class="verse">Is hasty credit and a distant bill;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, nursed in clubs, disdains a vulgar trade,</div>
<div class="verse">Exults to trust, and blushes to be paid.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both clubs, although more or less instituted for
the purpose of gambling, were at first political.
White’s, however, soon took down the Tory flag
and received members without reference to their
political opinions. Brooks’s, on the other hand,
remained true to its Whig traditions; and it was
to counterbalance the influence of this institution&mdash;the
“Reform” of that time&mdash;that the Carlton
Club was organised by Lord Clanwilliam and
others. These, with Boodles’, were the great
resorts of the dandies; and the bay window at
White’s, when Brummell was the lion, was one of
the sights of the town. The Prince of Wales was
a member of Brooks’s; but when his boon companions
Tarleton and Jack Payne were blackballed
he withdrew, and on his own account
founded a new club, of which the manager was
Weltzie, his house-steward.</p>

<p>Watier’s, the great macao gambling-house, was
founded in 1807; but play was very high, and
it lasted only for twelve years. According to
Gronow it came into existence in a somewhat<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
curious way. When some members of White’s
and Brooks’s were dining at Carlton House, the
Prince of Wales asked what sort of dinners
were served at these institutions. One of the
guests complained: “The eternal joints and
beefsteaks, the boiled fowl with oyster sauce,
and an apple-tart. This is what we have, sir, at
our clubs, and very monotonous fare it is.” The
Prince sent for Watier, his <i>chef</i>, and asked if he
would take a house and organise a club-dinner.
Watier was willing. The scheme was carried
out, and the club was famed for its exquisite
cuisine.</p>

<p>Another and more circumstantial account of the
founding of the club is given by Raikes. He says
it was originally instituted as a harmonic meeting
by the Maddochs, Calverts and Lord Headfort,
who took a house in Piccadilly, at the
corner of Bolton Street, and engaged Watier
as master of the revels. “This destination of the
club was soon changed. The dinners were so
<i>recherché</i> and so much talked of in town that
all the young men of fashion and fortune became
members of it. The catches and glees were then
superseded by cards and dice; the most luxurious
dinners were furnished at any price, as the deep
play at night rendered all charges a matter of
indifference. Macao was the constant game, and<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
thousands passed from one to another with as
much facility as marbles.”</p>

<p>The Duke of York was a member of Watier’s,
and so too was Byron, who christened it “The
Dandy Club.”</p>

<p>Another member was Robert Bligh, whose
eccentricities were already verging upon insanity.
One night, at the macao-table, Brummell was
losing heavily, and in an affected tone of tragedy
he called to a waiter to bring him a pistol.
Thereupon Bligh, who was his <i>vis-à-vis</i>, produced
from his coat pockets a pair of loaded
pistols, and laying them on the table, said,
“Mr Brummell, if you are really desirous to
put a period to your existence, I am extremely
happy to offer you the means without troubling
the waiter.” The feelings of the members may be
imagined when the knowledge was forced upon
them that in their midst was a madman who
carried loaded firearms.</p>

<p>Brummell, Raikes has recorded, was the
supreme dictator at Watier’s, “the club’s perpetual
president.” At the height of his prosperity,
one night when he entered, the macao-table was
full. Sheridan was there trying his luck with a few
pounds he could ill spare, for he had fallen upon
evil days. Brummell, whose good luck was
notorious at this time, offered to take Sheridan’s<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
seat and go shares in his deal. He added two
hundred pounds in counters to the ten pounds in
front of him, took the cards, dealt, and in a
quarter of an hour had won fifteen hundred
pounds. Then he left the table and divided his
gains with Sheridan. “Go home, Sheridan,” he
said quietly; “go home and give your wife and
brats a supper, and never play again.” It is good
to be able to record a generous act, delicately
done, of a much-abused man.</p>

<p>Of Brummell’s witty insolence mention has
already been made, but the laugh was once at
least against him. He was at the card-table playing
with Combe the brewer, an Alderman who
had passed the chair. “Come, Mashtub,” he
said, being the caster, “what do you set?”
“Twenty-five guineas.” “Well, then, have at the
mare’s pony” (twenty-five guineas). The game
progressed, and Brummell won twelve times in
succession. “Thank you, Alderman,” he said;
“for the future I shall never drink any porter
but yours.” “I wish, sir,” retorted Combe, “that
every other blackguard in London would say the
same.”</p>

<p>Everybody played cards in those days. Even
at the quiet Court of “Farmer” George the
tables were set out in the Queen’s drawing-rooms.
Ladies gambled with as much zest as their<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
husbands and brothers, and at the end of the
eighteenth century several held gaming-tables.
“Faro goes on as briskly as ever; those who
have not fortune enough of their own to live on
have recourse to this profitable game in order to
raise contributions on their friends,” wrote
Anthony Storer to Lord Auckland in 1791.
“The ladies are all embarked in banks. Mrs
Strutt, Lady Archer, Mrs Hobart, Lady Elizabeth
Luttrell (sister of the Duchess of Cumberland),
are avowed bankers; others, I suppose, are secretly
concerned.” Information was laid against Lady
Archer and Lady Buckinghamshire, who were
convicted and fined; and Lord Kenyon, delivering
judgment in another case, actually declared that
if any titled ladies were found guilty of the offence
before him they should stand in the pillory. No
one was bold enough to test the sincerity of the
threat. As <i>The Morning Post</i> put it in its issue for
15th January 1800: “Society has reason to rejoice
in the complete downfall of the Faro Dames who
were so long the disgrace of human nature. Their
<i>die</i> is cast, and their <i>odd tricks</i> avail no longer.
The <i>game</i> is up, and very few of them have <i>cut</i>
with <i>honours</i>.”</p>

<p>Play was taken very seriously, for the stakes
were always heavy, and conversation was resented.
Sir Philip Francis came to Brooks’s wearing for<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
the first time the ribbon of the Order of the
Bath, for which Fox had recommended him. “So
this is the way they have rewarded you at last,”
remarked Roger Wilbraham, coming up to the
whist-table. “They have given you a little bit of
red ribbon for your services, Sir Philip, have
they? A pretty bit of red ribbon to hang about
your neck; and that satisfies you, does it? Now,
I wonder what I shall have. What do you think
they will give me, Sir Philip?” “A halter, I trust
and hope!” roared the infuriated player.</p>

<p>It was at Almack’s, and later at White’s,
Brooks’s, Weltzie’s and Watier’s, that the heaviest
play prevailed. It is no exaggeration to say that
during the long sittings at macao, hazard and
faro many tens of thousands changed hands.
Nelson won three hundred pounds at a gaming-table
when he was seventeen; but he was so
horrified when he reflected if he had lost he could
not have paid that he never played again. Pitt
gambled, and George Selwyn, and Fox, who was
always unlucky.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“At Almack’s, of pigeons I’m told there are flocks,</div>
<div class="verse">But it’s thought the completest is one Mr Fox.</div>
<div class="verse">If he touches a card, if he rattles a box,</div>
<div class="verse">Away fly the guineas of this Mr Fox.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Fox lost two hundred thousand pounds in a<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
night. Once he played for twenty-two hours
and lost five hundred pounds an hour. It was he
who said that the greatest pleasure in life, after
winning, was losing. His bad luck was notorious,
and Walpole wondered what he would do when
he had sold the estates of all his friends. How
Fox contrived to make a great reputation as a
statesman, considering his mode of life, is truly
remarkable. It was noticed that he did not
shine in the debate on the Thirty-Nine Articles
(6th February 1772). Walpole thought it could
not be wondered at. “He had sat up playing at
hazard at Almack’s from Tuesday evening, the
4th, till five in the afternoon of Wednesday, 5th.
An hour before, he had recovered twelve thousand
pounds that he had lost, and by dinner, which was
at five o’clock, he had ended losing eleven thousand
pounds. On the Thursday he spoke in the above
debate, went to dinner at half-past eleven at
night, from there to White’s, where he drank
till seven the next morning; thence to Almack’s,
where he won six thousand pounds, and between
three and four in the afternoon he set out for
Newmarket. His brother Stephen lost ten thousand
pounds two nights after, and Charles eleven
thousand pounds more on the 13th, so that in
three nights the two brothers, the eldest not
twenty-five, lost thirty-two thousand pounds.”<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
One night when Fox had been terribly unlucky,
Topham Beauclerk followed him to his rooms to
offer consolation, expecting to find him perhaps
stretched on the floor bewailing his losses, perhaps
plunged into moody despair. He was surprised
to find him reading Herodotus. “What would
you have me do?” he asked his astonished visitor.
“I have lost my last shilling.”</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They were good losers in those days, and it
was a very necessary quality for the majority to
possess, since all played and most lost. Lord
Carlisle (who complained of <i>cette lassitude de tout
et de moi-même, qu’on appelle ennui</i>), General Fitzpatrick,
“Old Q.,” Lord Hertford, Lord Sefton,
the Duke of York, and many others squandered
vast sums in this amusement. There were not a
great many winners. The Duke of Portland was
one; and his and Canning’s father-in-law,
General Scott, won two hundred thousand
pounds. It was said the success of the latter
was due not only to his knowledge of the game
of whist, but also to his notorious sobriety.
General Fitzpatrick and Lord Robert Spencer<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
lost all their money at Brooks’s; but, the
members not objecting, with borrowed capital
they kept a faro bank. The bank won, and with
his share of one hundred thousand pounds Lord
Robert bought the estate of Woolbidding, in
Sussex. He had learnt his lesson, and he never
played again. There were few who had the sense
to make or the strength to keep such a resolution.
Mrs Delany, however, tells of a Mr Thynne “who
has won this year so considerably that he has
paid off all his debts, bought a house and furnished
it, disposed of all his horses, hounds, etc., and
struck his name out of all the expensive subscriptions.”
A fortunate man, too, was Colonel
Aubrey, who had the reputation of being the
best whist and piquet player of his day. He
made two fortunes in India and lost them both,
and made a third at play from a five-pound note
which he borrowed.</p>

<p>Another celebrated faro bank at Brooks’s was
that kept by Lord Cholmondeley, Mr Thompson
of Grosvenor Square, Tom Stepney, and a fourth.
It ruined half the town; and a Mr Paul, who
had come home with a fortune from India,
punting against the bank, lost ninety thousand
pounds in one night, and at once went Eastward
Ho! to make another. Lord Cholmondeley and
Mr Thompson realised between three and four<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
hundred thousand pounds apiece; but Stepney
so frequently played against his partners that
what he won on one side he lost on the
other, with the result that his gains were inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Foreigners were made honorary members of
the clubs. The Duke of Orleans (“Vile Égalité,”
Lady Sarah Bunbury wrote him down) carried
off vast sums. During the visit of the Allied
Sovereigns, Blücher, an inveterate gambler, lost
twenty thousand pounds. Count Montrond, on
the other hand, was a winner. “Who the deuce
is this Montrond?” the Duke of York asked
Upton. “They say, sir, that he is the most
agreeable scoundrel and the greatest reprobate
in France.” “Is he, by Jove?” cried the Duke.
“Then let us ask him to dinner immediately.”
Montrond was a witty fellow, and one of his
<i>bon mots</i> has been handed down. The Bailli de
Ferretti was always dressed in knee-breeches,
with a cocked hat and a Court sword, the slender
proportions of which resembled those of his legs.
“Do tell me, my dear Bailli,” said Montrond
one day, “have you got three legs or three
swords?”</p>

<p>Englishmen were not backward in playing
abroad, and they assembled in great numbers
at the Salon des Étrangers in Paris during the<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
stay of the army of occupation after Waterloo.
Gronow gives a long list of habitués: Henry
Baring, Tom Sowerby, Henry Broadwood, Bob
Arnold, Steer, Colonel Sowerby, were the most
reckless plungers. Lord Thanet, who had an
income of fifty thousand pounds, lost every
penny he had at the <i>salon</i>. He would not stop
playing when the public tables closed, and used
to invite those present to remain and play hazard
or écarté. One night he lost a hundred and twenty
thousand pounds. His friends told him he had
most probably been cheated. “Then,” he said
with great coolness, “I consider myself lucky
not to have lost twice as much.”</p>

<p>Prominent among gamblers, and as such deserving
of special mention, was William Douglas,
Earl of March and Ruglen, afterwards fourth and
last Duke of Queensberry<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> Even making liberal
allowance for the spirit of the age and for the
state of morality in the days when he was young,
he was one of the worst men of his generation;
and his rank and wealth made his vices only more
notorious. He was the “Degenerate Douglas” of
Wordsworth’s muse, and Burns damned him in
verse for all time:</p>

<p>He was appointed to the Household of
George III.; but when the King’s malady declared
itself in 1788, he, in common with many other
courtiers, veered round to the side of the Prince
of Wales. George recovered, and the Duke was
dismissed. His profligacy was a byword, and he
pursued pleasure to the end of his days. He built
a palace at Richmond, where many orgies took
place. But he tired of that residence, as he wearied
of most people and most things. “What is there
to make so much of in the Thames? I am quite
tired of it. There it goes, flow, flow, flow, always
the same.” At the end of his days he sat on the
balcony of a ground-floor room of his Piccadilly
mansion, and ogled the passers-by, while a footman
held a parasol over his head, and another
was ready to follow and find out the residence of<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
any pretty girl that passed. Yet “Old Q.” had wit
in plenty, loved music, and was not without appreciation
of letters and art. One of his greatest
friends was George Selwyn; and, while both
accredited themselves with the paternity, neither
knew which was the father of Maria Fagniani.
This young lady became Selwyn’s ward and the
inheritrix of the greater part of his fortune, while
the Duke left her his residence in Piccadilly, a
villa at Richmond, and a hundred and fifty
thousand pounds; and her husband, Lord Yarmouth,
afterwards third Marquis of Hertford,
as the Duke’s residuary legatee, came into about
two hundred thousand pounds.</p>

<p>“Old Q.” was a dangerous man at the card-table.
The turf had no mysteries for him. He was ever
ready to bet, and he preferred to bet on something
that was very nearly a certainty. He was full of
resource, and his success was due at least as much
to his cleverness as to his luck. His was the day of
wagers, and at White’s a betting-book was laid
upon a table for all bets made in the building to
be inserted. His name frequently occurs therein:</p>

<p>“<i>June 1751.</i>&mdash;Lord March wagers Captain
Richard Vernon fifty guineas to twenty that Mr
St Leger is married before him.” The bet requires
the explanatory note that “him” stands
for Captain Vernon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span></p>

<p>“<i>March 1784.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Queensberry
bets Mr Grenville ten guineas to five that Mr
Fox does not stand a poll for Westminster if the
Parliament should be dissolved within a month
from the date hereof. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;If a coalition takes
place between Mr Pitt and Mr Fox this bet is to
be off.” It is to be noticed that the Duke was
not convinced of the sincerity of politicians.</p>

<p>The Duke bet Sir John Lade a thousand guineas
as to which could produce a man to eat the most
at one sitting. The Duke could not be present at
the contest, but he received the result from a representative.
“I have not time to state particulars,
but merely to acquaint your Grace that your man
beat his antagonist by a pig and an apple-pie.”
What must they have eaten!</p>

<p>White’s betting-book is full of quaint wagers.
“Lord Northington bets Mr C. Fox, June 4, 1774,
that he (Mr. C.&nbsp;F.) is not called to the Bar before
this day four years.” On 11th March 1775 is an
interesting entry: “Lord Bolingbroke gives a
guinea to Mr Charles Fox, and is to receive a
thousand from him whenever the debt of this
country amounts to one hundred and seventy-one
millions. Mr Fox is not to pay the thousand
pounds till he is one of his Majesty’s Cabinet.”
The following is dated 7th April 1792: “Mr
Sheridan bets Lord Lauderdale and Lord Thanet<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
twenty-five guineas each that Parliament will
not consent to any more lotteries after the present
one voted to be drawn in February next.” Lotteries
were then a regular source of revenue to the State,
the average profit being about three hundred and
fifty thousand pounds a year, besides many
brokers’ annual licences at fifty pounds. Private
lotteries were forbidden by law, and required a
special Act of Parliament to enable them to be
drawn. The result was that the only two private
lotteries were the Pigot Diamond in 1800 and
Boydell’s pictures five years later. Lotteries were
first drawn at Guildhall and later at the Coopers’
Hall, and the tickets were taken from the wheels
by Bluecoat boys. The last public lottery took
place in October 1826, and so Mr Sheridan lost
his bet.</p>

<p>On 8th May 1809, “Mr G. Talbot bet Lord
Charles Manners ten guineas that the Duke of
Queensberry is not alive this day two years.”
Another entry records that “Mr C.&nbsp;H. Bouverie
bets Mr Blackford that the Duke of Queensberry
outlives the Duke of Grafton.” “Lord Mountford
bets Sir John Bland twenty guineas that Nash
outlives Cibber.” But the bet was cancelled, because
before either Nash or Cibber died the two
wagerers committed suicide!</p>

<p>Apparently no subject was thought unfit for a<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
bet. Wagers were made as to which of two
married ladies would first give birth to a live
child, and as to which of two men would marry
first. They bet with equal heartiness on the
duration of a Ministry or the life of a Minister,
on a horse, or a dog, or a prize-fight, or a cock-fight.
Walpole tells the story of a simple parson
entering White’s on the morning of a severe
earthquake, and hearing bets laid whether the
shock was caused by an earthquake or the blowing
up of powder mills, went away in horror,
protesting that they were such an impious set
that he believed if the Last Trump were to sound
they would bet puppet-show against Judgment!</p>

<p>All other English clubs where gaming took
place fade into insignificance before Crockford’s.
Crockford was originally a fishmonger at the old
Bulkshop next door to Temple Bar Without, and
later a “leg” at Newmarket. He became part-proprietor
of a gambling-house, and with his
partner, at a twenty-four hours’ sitting, he won
a hundred thousand pounds from five punters,
including Lord Thanet, Lord Granville and Ball
Hughes. He then built the famous palace in
St James’s Street opposite to White’s.</p>

<p>“No one can describe the splendour and excitement
of the early days of Crockford’s,” Gronow
relates. “A supper of the most exquisite kind,<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
prepared by the famous Ude, and accompanied by
the best wines in the world, together with every
luxury of the season, was provided gratis. The
members of the club included all the celebrities of
England, from the Duke of Wellington to the
youngest ensign of the Guards; and at the gay
and festive board, which was constantly replenished
from midnight till early dawn, the most brilliant
sallies of wit, the most agreeable conversation, the
most interesting anecdotes, interspersed with grave
political discussions and acute logical reasoning
on every conceivable subject, proceeded from the
soldiers, scholars, statesmen, poets, and men of
pleasure, who, when the House was ‘up’ and
balls and parties at an end, delighted to finish their
evenings with a little supper and a good deal of
hazard at old Crockey’s. The tone of the club was
excellent. A most gentleman-like feeling prevailed,
and none of the rudeness, familiarity, and
ill-breeding which disgrace some of the minor clubs
of the present day would have been tolerated for
a moment.”</p>

<p>The whole establishment was organised on a
scale of wonderful magnificence; and to keep it
select, the election of members was controlled by
a committee. Talleyrand, Pozzo di Borgo, General
Alava, Esterhazy, and other ambassadors belonged
to it; the Duke of Wellington, Lord Raglan,<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
Lord Anglesea, Sir Hussey Vivian, Disraeli,
Bulwer, Croker, Horace Twiss, and, as a matter
of course, Lord Alvanley and Count D’Orsay.
Though many members never touched a card,
Crockford with his hazard bank won a sum
estimated at between one million two hundred
thousand and two million pounds, or, as a contemporary
put it very neatly, “the whole of the
ready money of the then existing generation.”
He died worth seven hundred thousand pounds,
after having sustained heavy losses in mining and
other speculations. The retirement of Crockford
marks an epoch, for after that date the craze for
gambling on a vast scale slowly but surely died
out. By this time, however, it had done as much
harm to the aristocracy as the South Sea Bubble
did to the general public.</p>

<h2>A Forgotten Satirist: “Peter Pindar”</h2>


<p class="dropcap">The amusing banter of Mr E.&nbsp;V. Lucas
and Mr C.&nbsp;L. Graves, and the delightful
parody of Mr Owen Seaman, are
the nearest approach that England can now show
to the satirical productions for which it was once
famous. Indeed, we are becoming an amiable race,
developing, or at least feigning, the milk of
human kindness to such an extent that even
modern caricature can scarcely be distinguished
from portraiture, and only Mr Max Beerbohm
flings the tomahawk of pictorial satire. A study
of the lampoons and the vigorous personal onslaughts
in prose and verse of the Georgian days,
however, gives us pause for reflection whether
we refrain from such practices because of our
improved manners or increasing effeminacy:
though, perhaps, it may be attributed largely to
the signed review which makes it difficult, in
these days of numerous literary associations, for
a sociable or a nervous scholar to gibbet his
erring brethren with an acerbity once general.
Certain it is that current criticism is for the most
part the art of saying pleasant things graciously,
while our excursions into the personal element
are usually headed “Appreciations.” Whatever
the cause, it is a sad thought for militant spirits
that a wave of politeness has engulfed the heretofore
blunt, outspoken John Bull, that typical<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
figure, of which&mdash;it is pathetic to note in these
days of unsuppressed emotion&mdash;we are still so
proud.</p>

<p>The most casual incursion into Georgian history
reveals a great mass of almost forgotten satirical
productions, all of it trenchant, most of it coarse
and not a little scurrilous, indeed, but much of it
readable and amusing. There were scores of virile
pamphleteers in the pay of Ministers and Oppositions,
as well as a number of independent writers
of lampoons on all sorts and conditions of men
and things. The best of the latter class was Charles
Churchill, the famous author of “The Rosciad”
and of those terrible onslaughts on Hogarth and
Sandwich, on Martin and other small fry. His
mantle was in due course assumed by Wolcot,
who, though scarcely remembered to-day, was a
man of considerable talent and extensive knowledge,
and, though of course without the genius
of his predecessor, was widely read, enjoyed a
vast popularity, and undoubtedly influenced a
great body of people.</p>

<p>John Wolcot, the son of a country surgeon,
was born in May 1738. He was educated at
various schools of no great repute, and in the
early twenties paid a lengthy visit to France, for
the inhabitants of which land he conceived the
insular prejudice usual in his day:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“I never will put Merit on the rack:</div>
<div class="verse">No; yet, I own, I hate the shrugging dogs.</div>
<div class="verse">I’ve lived among them, eat their frogs,</div>
<div class="verse">And vomited them up, thank God, again.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He studied medicine in London until 1764,
when he went as assistant to his uncle, John
Wolcot of Fowey, taking a Scotch Degree of
Doctor of Medicine three years later, immediately
after which, his distant connection, Sir William
Trelawny, going to Jamaica as Governor, he accompanied
him as physician. In that island he
saw little or no prospect of securing a paying
practice, and paid a flying visit to England in
1769 to take holy orders. On his return to Jamaica
he found that the lucrative living for which he
had been destined, had, contrary to expectation,
not been vacated, whereupon, after holding a minor
clerical post for a few months, he reverted to his
old profession, and obtained the post of physician-general
to the troops. Sir William Trelawny died
at Spanish Town in 1772, and Wolcot again came
to England, where he established himself as a
doctor at Truro, but, after disputes with his medical
<i>confrères</i> and the Corporation, removed in 1779 to
Helstone and then to Exeter.</p>

<p>Wolcot abandoned the practice of medicine in
1781, when he came to London, urged to this
step partly by the desire to advance the prospects<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
of his <i>protégé</i>, Opie, the painter, and partly by the
desire to establish himself there as a man of
letters. The last project was not so mad as it may
have appeared to his country neighbours, for under
the pseudonym of “Peter Pindar” he had already
obtained some success with the publication of a
“Poetical Epistle to Reviewers” in 1778, in
which he declared:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“In Sonnet, Ode, and Legendary Tale,</div>
<div class="verse">Soon will the press my tuneful Works display.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He fulfilled this promise, and in 1782
issued “Lyric Odes to the Royal Academicians
for 1782,” by “Peter Pindar, Esq., a distant
relative of the Poet of Thebes and Laureat to the
Academy,” which were at once so successful, that
in quick succession came from his fertile pen,
“More Lyric Odes to the Royal Academicians
for 1783,” “Lyric Odes for 1785,” and, in 1786,
“Farewell Odes to Academicians.” These vigorous
verses attracted much attention, for the critic was
outspoken in his dislikes, and lashed with the
utmost contempt “George’s idol,” West, and other
fashionable artists; though he showed his discrimination
by praising the works of Gainsborough,
Reynolds (“Of whose fine art I own myself a
lover”), and of the unfairly neglected Richard
Wilson (“By Britain left in poverty to pine”):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“But honest Wilson, never mind;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Immortal praises thou shalt find,</div>
<div class="verse">And for a dinner have no cause to fear.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thou start’st at my prophetic rhymes:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Don’t be impatient for those times;</div>
<div class="verse">Wait till thou hast been dead a hundred year.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was not because Wolcot had exhausted this
vein (for he returned to it again and again, even
in 1808 having “One more Peep at the Royal
Academy”) that he looked for another theme, but
that he discovered, so long as he wrote on art and
artists, let him be never so humorous, he would
have to be content with praise alone for his reward.
No man cared less for money than he, but he
certainly thought the labourer worthy of his hire,
and, since he depended for his livelihood on his
pen, it behoved him to select a subject that would
appeal to a larger public. To the exceeding joy
of his own and subsequent generations, he decided
to exercise his humour at the expense of the King
and Queen, with an occasional playful blow at a
Minister.</p>

<p>No satirist could ask for better subjects for his
wit than George III. and Queen Charlotte. The
slow-witted monarch and his parsimonious consort
offered every conceivable temptation to Wolcot’s
nimble humour, and he was not slow to take advantage
of this rare chance. Of course, he was not<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
the first in the field, but he was head and shoulders
over his rivals in talent and wit, and, if he did
not silence, at least he succeeded in eclipsing them.
He was especially fortunate in having accurate
information concerning the internal economy of
the royal palaces, and, though he took a poet’s
licence to embroider the facts, there was always
some foundation for his lampoons. Thus, when
the King found a noxious insect in his plate at
dinner and gave orders that everyone in the kitchens,
from <i>chef</i> to scullion, should be shaved, “Peter
Pindar” wrote a “heroi-comic poem,” “The
Lousiad,” in which he gave a version of the story.
“I had this (incident),” he wrote to a friend,
“from the cooks themselves, with whom I dined
several times at Buckingham House and Windsor,
immediately after the ‘shave’ took place.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent2">“&#8201;‘Some spirit whispers that to Cooks I owe</div>
<div class="verse">The precious Visitor that crawls below;</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, yes, the whispering Spirit tells me true,</div>
<div class="verse">And soon that vengeance all the locks pursue.</div>
<div class="verse">Cooks, Scourers, Scullions, too, with Tails of Pig,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall lose their coxcomb Curls and wear a Wig.’</div>
<div class="verse">Thus roared the King, not Hercules so big;</div>
<div class="verse">And all the Palace echoed, ‘Wear a Wig!’&#8201;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So successful was the first canto of “The
Lousiad,” which appeared in 1785, that during
the next ten years four additional cantos were<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
written, in which members of the Household and
Ministers were introduced, scarified and dismissed;
but the gem of the collection is the lengthy
“Petition of the Cooks,” which, after references
to France, the Schwellenberg and Wilkes, concludes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent2">“&#8201;‘O King, our Wives are in the Kitchen roaring,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">All ready in rebellion now to rise;</div>
<div class="verse">They mock our humble methods of imploring,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And bid us guard against a wig surprise:</div>
<div class="verse">“<i>Yours</i> is the hair,” they cry, “th’ Almighty gave ye,</div>
<div class="verse">And not a King in Christendom should shave you.’&#8201;”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Lo! on th’ event the World impatient looks,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And thinks the joke is carried much too far;</div>
<div class="verse">Then pray, Sir, listen to your faithful Cooks,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Nor in the Palace breed a Civil War:</div>
<div class="verse">Loud roar our Band; and, obstinate as Pigs,</div>
<div class="verse">Cry, “Locks and Liberty and damn the Wigs!”&#8201;’&#8201;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Eventually the attention of the Privy Council
was drawn to this poem, and that body, according
to Wolcot, decided to prosecute the author, and
refrained from doing so only when it discovered
that the poem had its foundation in fact. “Are
you sure of a verdict?” it is stated that Chancellor
Thurlow inquired; “for, if not so, we shall look
like a parcel of fools.” Huish states emphatically
that the idea of prosecuting the poet did not
originate with the King; and Galt says that the<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
effusions of the satirist produced on George “no
other effect than a smile of wonder at the perverse
ingenuity of the man: and the most serious thing
he was ever known to say of them was on the
occasion of Peter’s lampooning General Carpenter,
when his Majesty observed, that ‘for himself he
cared nothing; but he was hurt to see a worthy
man calumniated, because he happened to be one
of his servants.’ As far as they were capable of
exciting a good-natured laugh, the King enjoyed
that laugh as much as any man; and when they
were otherwise, as was but too often the case,
he observed a dignified forbearance, leaving the
author to enjoy all the triumph there might be in
making a base attack on a party whom he knew
to be precluded, by his dignity, from descending
into the arena in his own defence.”</p>

<p>It may, however, he doubted whether Hazlitt
was accurate in stating that “the King as well as
the nation delighted in the bard,” for George had
not a spark of humour in his composition, and
was the last man in the nation to take a joke at
his own expense in good part.</p>

<p>If, however, the King suffered in silence, the
Queen was determined not to submit to similar
attacks, and her solicitor warned Wolcot that if
he exercised his wit against her Majesty, proceedings
would at once be taken&mdash;representations that<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
had the desired effect, although they furnished the
subject for one of Peter’s verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Great was the Bard’s desire to sing the Queen,</div>
<div class="verse">Vast in her soul, majestic in her mien;</div>
<div class="verse">But fierce George Hardinge swore, if pens or pen</div>
<div class="verse">Of woman, women, man or men,</div>
<div class="verse">In any wise or shape, in Ode or Tale,</div>
<div class="verse">Dared mention that <i>superior</i> Lady, lo!</div>
<div class="verse">The law should deal them <i>such</i> a blow!</div>
<div class="verse">Hang, pillory, or confine for life in jail.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Doctor was once reproved by an
acquaintance for the liberties he took with his
sovereign, “I confess there exists this difference
between the King and me,” he replied; “the King
has been a good subject to me, but I have been a
bad subject to him.” This he admitted, but that
he was guilty in any sense of serious offence he
pooh-poohed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Such is the Song: and do not thou, severe,</div>
<div class="verse">With ‘Treason! Treason!’ fill a royal ear;</div>
<div class="verse">For gentle jokes, at times, on Queens and Kings,</div>
<div class="verse">Are pleasant, taking, nay, <i>instructive</i> things.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet <i>some</i> there are who relish not the sport,</div>
<div class="verse">That flutter in the sunshine of a Court;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, fearful Song might mar their high ambition,</div>
<div class="verse">Loose the gaunt Dogs of State, and bawl ‘Sedition.’&#8201;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wolcot was clever enough usually to take for his
verse topics in which the public were interested,<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
and it was to this acuteness his success with his
contemporaries must be largely attributed. He
attacked Lord Lonsdale when that nobleman
showed a great disregard of his neighbour’s rights,
and “expostulated” with Hannah More, when in
her “Strictures on Female Education,” she wrote,
“The Poets again, to do them justice, are always
ready to lend a helping hand when any mischief
is to be done.” He inveighed against the strict
enforcement of Sunday Observance, which to
some extent resulted from Lady Huntingdon’s
petition to the King, and the Puritanism of the
Methodists:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent2">“&#8201;‘No,’ roars the Huntingdonian Priest; ‘no, no:</div>

<div class="verse indent2">The <i>Devil claws</i> away the rogue and jade.’&#8201;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And he gave a fanciful description of the result
of the unpopular Hair-Tax, which, according to
him, evoked so much disgust that, “the male sex
have already sacrificed their favourite curls, to disappoint
the rapacity of a minister.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Wolcot, as a defender of Mrs Fitzherbert,
thought no words too strong in which to express
his opinion of those who attacked her, and when
John Rolle introduced the question of her
marriage to the Prince of Wales in the House of
Commons, he fell foul of him, and of Pitt, who
supported him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>He had the courage to say a good word for

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was fearless in his denunciation of the Duke
of York, when it transpired that during the<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
latter’s occupation of the position of Commander-in-Chief,
his mistress had been selling commissions
and offices, and he voiced the public clamour:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Heavens, what a dire confusion beauty makes!</div>
<div class="verse">The Horse Guards tremble, and old Windsor shakes.</div>

<div class="verse">Cry from their cages naught but ‘Duke and Darling’!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When, as a consequence of the inquiry, the
Duke resigned, Wolcot drew a malicious picture
of his loneliness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“No longer now the Duke excites our wonder,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span></p>

<p>Wolcot sometimes contrived to combine his
attacks upon art and royalty, as in “Subjects for
Painters,” in the introduction to which he explained
that the rage for historical pictures,
“so nobly rewarded by Messieurs Boydell and

<p>As a rule, however, Wolcot directed his
lampoons against the King, whose foibles he most
unmercifully laid bare. He was never weary of
decrying a monarch who preferred farming to
art, and whose economies were a source of scandal<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
to the whole nation. It is said that the bitterness
on this latter score arose from the King having
purchased a picture from a friend of the satirist
and having given him only half the market value.
This, indeed, was only one instance out of many
of George’s meanness. He would put an artist to
the expense of bringing his pictures to Windsor,
and not offer to pay the carriage, even when, in
the case of one such command, the cost was
twenty-five pounds. He would invite eminent
singers and actors to perform at Court functions
and give them never a sou, thinking the honour
sufficient reward.</p>

<p>The King’s love of farming for profit&mdash;a king
with a Civil List of eight hundred thousand pounds

a subject much discussed, and not likely to

<p>Since it was thought unwise to prosecute
Wolcot, after a time an endeavour was made
to silence him by gentler means, and, through

<p>He often returned to administer castigation to

<p>Wolcot’s sight began to fail, and in 1811 he was
nearly blind, but he still contrived to continue his
literary work almost until his death, which took
place on 14th January 1819. By his express desire
he was buried in St Paul’s Church, Covent
Garden, by the side of the coffin which contained<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
the mortal remains of Samuel Butler, of whom,
perhaps, and not without some reason, he considered
himself a humble disciple.</p>

<p>He was a very sane man, sensible of his
limitations, and not given to value his work
unduly. Indeed, in his first work, “The Epistle
to Reviewers,” he stated the position to which he
aspired:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“I am no cormorant for Fame, d’ye see;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I ask not <i>all</i> the laurel, but a <i>sprig</i>:</div>
<div class="verse">Then hear me, Guardian of the sacred Tree,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And stick a Leaf or two about my wig.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the same time, he was by no means inclined to
hide his light under a bushel, and his verses contain
many deliberately humorous references to
his talents. “Had I not stepped forward as the
Champion of my own Merit (which is deemed so
necessary now-a-days for the obtention of public
notice, not only by Authors, but by tête-makers,
perfumers, elastic truss and Parliament-speech
makers, &amp;c., who, in the daily newspapers, are
the heralds of <i>their own</i> splendid abilities),” he
wrote in “Subjects for Painters,” “I might
possibly be passed by without observation; and
thus a great part of a poetical Immortality be
sacrificed to a pitiful <i>mauvaise honte</i>.”</p>

<p>Of course he made many enemies, as every<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
satirist must, but he bore attacks unflinchingly,
as, indeed, every satirist should.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As a rule he treated his revilers with good-humoured
banter, but once a critic raised his ire
by an unmerciful attack on his “Nil Admirari, or,
A Smile at a Bishop,” in <i>The Anti-Jacobin</i>, in which
he was styled, “this disgraceful subject, the profligate
reviler of his sovereign and impudent
blasphemer of his God.” Gifford at once issued
as a counterblast, “An Epistle to Peter Pindar,”
the savagery of which made the subject so sore
that he endeavoured to thrash the author, who,
however, had the best of the struggle.</p>

<p>Yet the man of whom these words were spoken
was described by his friends as of “a kind and
hearty disposition,” with little or no malice in
his composition, a lover of flowers, music and
art. Not even his blindness or the infirmities of
age soured his temper, and in his last years he
said to Cyrus Redding, “You have seen something
of life in your time. See and learn all you
can more. You will fall back upon it when
you grow old&mdash;an old fool is an inexcusable
fool to himself and others&mdash;store up all; our
acquirements are most useful when we become
old.” Yet he did not suffer age gladly, and when
on his death-bed John Taylor asked, “Is there
anything I can do for you?” the reply&mdash;Wolcot’s
last words on earth&mdash;came. “Bring
me back my youth.”</p>

<p>“The historian of <i>Sir Joseph Banks</i> and <i>The
Emperor of Morocco</i>, of the <i>Pilgrims and the Peas</i>,
of the <i>Royal Academy</i>, and of <i>Mr Whitebread’s
Brewing-Vat</i>, the bard in whom the nation and
the King delighted,” Hazlitt wrote the year
before the satirist died, “is old and blind, but
still merry and wise; remembering how he has
made the world laugh in his time, and not repenting
of the mirth he has given; with an
involuntary smile lighted up at the mad pranks
of his Muse, and the lucky hits of his pen&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>‘faint
pictures of those flashes of his spirit, that
were wont to set the table in a roar’; like his
own expiring taper, bright and fitful to the last;
tagging a rhyme or conning his own epitaph;
and waiting for the last summons, grateful and
contented.” Indeed, while the coarseness and
offensiveness of many of Wolcot’s works must
be admitted and deplored, it is impossible not to
like the man, for he was such a jovial wight, so
well able to appreciate a joke against himself and
ready to join in the laugh, a very prince of good
fellows in an age of less severe restrictions in taste
and morality.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span></p>
<h2>Sterne’s Eliza</h2>


<p class="dropcap">Not Swift so loved his Stella, Scarron
his Maintenon, or Waller his Sacharissa,
as I will love, and sing thee, my bride
elect! All these names, eminent as they were,
shall give place to thine, Eliza.” Thus Sterne
in a letter to Mrs Elizabeth Draper, written in
the early part of the year 1767; and though, in
spite of this fervent protestation, not Stella, nor
Maintenon, nor Sacharissa has paled before Eliza,
yet most assuredly Eliza has come to be ranked
with them among the heroines of romance.</p>

<p>Of the antecedents of Mrs Draper nothing
apparently was generally known to writers on the
subject until 1897, when Mr Thomas Seccombe,
in the article in the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i> on William Sclater, Rector of Pitminster,
showed that her descent could be traced
from William’s father, Anthony. Anthony Sclater,
born in 1520, was appointed in 1570 Rector of
Leighton Buzzard, which benefice he held until
his death in 1620, when he was succeeded in this
clerical office by a younger son, Christopher.
Christopher’s son William served in the Civil
Wars as a Cornet of Horse, and subsequently
entered the Church. He was presented in 1666
to the living of St James’s, Clerkenwell, and later
became Rector of Hadley. He died in 1690,
having outlived by five years his son Francis.<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>
Francis had a son Christopher, born in 1679, who
held the livings of Loughton and Chingford, in
Essex, married in 1707 Elizabeth, daughter of
John May, of Working, Hants, and by her had
thirteen children. The tenth son, May, born on
29th October 1719, went out to India, probably
as a cadet in the service of the East India Company,
and there married a Miss Whitehall, who
bore him three daughters, Elizabeth (Sterne’s
Eliza), born on 5th April 1744, Mary, and
Louisa. The only other children of Christopher
with which this narrative is concerned are
Elizabeth, who married Dr Thomas Pickering,
Vicar of St Sepulchre’s, and Richard, the fourth
son, born in 1712, who became an alderman of
the City of London<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>

<p>When his daughters were born, May Sclater
was factor of Anjengo, on the Malabar coast, and
it was long assumed that his girls were brought up
there. Even so late as 1893, Mr James Douglas,
the author of “Bombay and Western India,” gave
credence to the legend, and after stating that there
were very few Europeans at Anjengo, “it seems<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
a marvel,” he added, “how, never having been in
Europe, Eliza should yet have been able to carry
herself and attract so much attention there from
men who, whatever were their morals, claimed a
first position in society and letters.” However, as
a matter of fact, like most children born in India
of English parents, Eliza and her sisters were at an
early age sent home for the sake of their health.</p>

<p>In England Eliza stayed alternately with her
aunt, Mrs Pickering, and with her uncle, Richard,
for whose eldest children, Thomas Mathew and
Elizabeth, she conceived an enduring affection.
Not until she was in her fourteenth year did she
return to her father, now a widower, and she
arrived two days after Christmas, 1757, at
Bombay, where he then resided.</p>

<p>“I was never half so much rejoiced at going to
any ball in my life as when we first saw the land,”
(she wrote to her cousin in England, Elizabeth
Sclater, 13th March 1758). “The Dutch people
are white, but their servants are all black, they
wear nothing at all about them but a little piece
of rag about their waist which to us at first
appeared very shocking.”</p>

<p>“My Papa’s house is the best in Bombay, and
where a great deal of company comes every day
after dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span></p>

<p>Among the company that came to May
Sclater’s house was Daniel Draper, who, entering
the East India Company’s service in or about
1749, had in the intervening nine years risen
to a fairly good position. In those days lads
went out to India at an early age, and Draper, in
1757, may well have been no more than thirty,
though Dr Sidney Lee has suggested that he was
at least four years older. Draper fell in love with
Eliza, and married her on 28th July 1758, she
being then but fourteen. Such marriages, however,
were not then uncommon in India. Two
children were born of this union, a boy in 1759,
and a girl in October 1761.</p>

<p>Mrs Draper suffered from ill-health, and in
1765, with her husband and children, she came
to England. The children were taken to an
establishment at Enfield, where Anglo-Indian
children were cared for during the absence of their
parents in the tropical zone, and presently Draper
had to return to his post in Bombay. Mrs Draper,
however, remained in England to recover her
strength. She stayed with relatives of her mother
and father, but with her movements we are not
here concerned until she was temporarily domiciled
in London during the winter of 1766. It
was not until December of that year that she met
Sterne, probably at the town house in Gerrard<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
Street, Soho, of William James and his wife&mdash;the
“Mr and Mrs J.” of Sterne’s published
correspondence.</p>

<p>William James, Commodore of the Bombay
Marine, having amassed a fortune by prize-money
and mercantile enterprises, retired from the service
at the age of eight and thirty, and came to England
in 1759, when he purchased an estate at Eltham,
near Blackheath, and married Anne, daughter of
Edmund Goddard, of Hartham, in Wiltshire.
Presently he became chairman of the East India
Company, and in 1778, five years before his death,
he was made a baronet. When Sterne first became
acquainted with the Jameses cannot now be determined,
but probably it was not earlier than
after his return from the second visit to the
Continent. It is evident, however, that he was on
very intimate terms with them at the end of
1766, as his references to them in his letters to
Mrs Draper show, though they are mentioned
for the first time to his daughter, then with her
mother at Marseilles, in a letter dated 23rd February
1767. In this letter we learn that the gossips
were already busy coupling Sterne’s name with
Mrs Draper’s.</p>

<p>“I do not wish to know who was the busy fool,
who made your mother uneasy about Mrs Draper.<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
’Tis true I have a friendship for her, but not to
infatuation&mdash;I believe I have judgment enough
to discern hers, and every woman’s faults. I honour
thy mother for her answer&mdash;‘that she wished
not to be informed, and begged him to drop the
subject.’&#8201;”</p>

<p>Nor was Mrs Sterne’s informant the only person
who disapproved of the relations of Sterne and
Mrs Draper.</p>

<p>“The &mdash;&mdash;’s, by heavens, are worthless! I
have heard enough to tremble at the articulation of
the name.&mdash;How could you, Eliza, leave them (or
suffer them to leave you, rather), with impressions
the least favourable? I have told thee enough
to plant disgust against their treachery to thee,
to the last hour of thy life! Yet still, thou toldest
Mrs James at last, that thou believest they affectionately
love thee.&mdash;Her delicacy to my Eliza,
and true regard to her ease of mind, have saved
thee from hearing more glaring proofs of their
baseness.&mdash;For God’s sake write not to them; nor
foul thy fair character with such polluted hearts.
<i>They</i> love thee! What proof? Is it their actions
that say so? or their zeal for those attachments,
which do thee honour, and make thee happy?
or their tenderness for thy fame? No.&mdash;But they<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
<i>weep</i>, and say <i>tender things</i>.&mdash;Adieu to such for
ever. Mrs James’s honest heart revolts against
the idea of ever returning them one visit. I honour
her, and I honour thee, for almost every act of
thy life, but this blind partiality for an unworthy
being.”</p>

<p>The remonstrances of these friends of Eliza
were not so outrageous as Sterne deemed them.
There was, indeed, some ground for gossip, though
perhaps not for scandal&mdash;enough, certainly, to
alarm people interested in the lady: Sterne’s
visits to Mrs Draper were too frequent, and Mrs
Draper was so indiscreet as to visit Sterne at his
lodgings in Old Bond Street and dine there with
him <i>tête-à-tête</i>. There has been much discussion
as to whether the relations of the Brahmin and
the Brahmine, as they loved to call each other,
were innocent or guilty; but there can be no
doubt that the intimacy was not carried to the
last extreme. “I have had no commerce whatever
with the sex&mdash;not even with my wife&mdash;these
fifteen years,” Sterne told his physicians shortly
after Eliza had returned to India. This in itself
would not be conclusive evidence, though there
could have been no reason for him to lie to these
people; but the fact that he wrote down this
conversation in a Journal intended exclusively<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
for the eye of Mrs Draper makes it certain that
his assertion was accurate&mdash;at least, so far as he
and she were concerned. A man would scarcely
trouble falsely to tell his mistress in confidence
that he had had no intimacy with her. The
Jameses most certainly believed in the innocence
of the friendship, else they could scarcely have
countenanced it; and not even Thackeray, who
shares with John Croft the distinction of being
Sterne’s most envenomed critic, could have
believed that the following letter (whether ultimately
despatched or not) could have been written
by a guilty man.</p>


<p class="tac width50 mt2em">LAURENCE STERNE TO DANIEL DRAPER</p>

<p>“Sir, I own it, Sir, that the writing a Letter to
a gentleman I have not the honour to be known
to, and a Letter likewise upon no kind of business
(in the Ideas of the World) is a little out of the
common course of Things&mdash;but I’m so myself&mdash;and
the Impulse which makes me take up my
pen is out of the Common way too&mdash;for it arises
from the honest pain I should feel in avowing in
so great esteem and friendship as I bear Mrs
Draper&mdash;If I did not wish and hope to extend it
to Mr Draper also. I fell in Love with your
Wife&mdash;but ’tis a Love you would honour me for&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>for
’tis so like that I bear my own daughter
who is a good creature, that I scarce distinguish
a difference betwixt it&mdash;the moment I had&mdash;that
Moment would have been the last. I wish it had
been in my power to have been of true use to
Mrs Draper at this Distance from her best Protector&mdash;I
have bestowed a great deal of pains (or
rather I should say pleasure) upon her head&mdash;her
heart needs none&mdash;and her head as little as
any Daughter of Eve’s&mdash;and indeed less than any
it has been my fate to converse with for some
years.&mdash;I wish I could make myself of any Service
to Mrs Draper whilst she is in India&mdash;and I in
the world&mdash;for worldly affairs I could be of none.&mdash;I
wish you, dear Sir, many years’ happiness.
’Tis a part of my Litany to pray for her health
and Life&mdash;She is too good to be lost&mdash;and I would
out of pure zeal take a pilgrimage to Mecca to
seek a Medicine.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>If the intimacy was, as is here contended, not
carried to the last extreme, there is no doubt of
the vigour with which Sterne and his Brahmine
flirted, and therefore Sterne cannot be acquitted
of insincerity when he wrote to Daniel Draper
that he looked upon Eliza as a daughter. But if
there is little that is paternal in the few letters of<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
his to Mrs Draper that have been preserved, on
the other hand there is nothing from which the
conclusion of undue intimacy can be built up.</p>

<p>It may be taken for granted that Mrs Draper’s
feelings were not very deeply engaged by Sterne.
A woman of three and twenty does not often find
such enduring attraction in a man of four and fifty
as a man of that age does in a woman more than
thirty years his junior. But Sterne had fame and
undoubted powers of fascination, and Mrs Draper
had in her composition an innocent vanity that
induced her to encourage him. The homage of
one of the most famous men in England was a
compliment not lightly to be ignored; and, being
flattered, Eliza, unhappy at home, was far from
unwilling to enjoy herself abroad. She was clever
and bright&mdash;perhaps a little bitter, too, remembering
that she had been married before she was old
enough to know what marriage meant, to a man
with uncongenial tastes, dour, and bad-tempered.
It is to her credit that she never told Sterne of
her marital infelicity, though candid friends left
him in no doubt as to her relations with her husband.
“Mrs James sunk my heart with an infamous
account of Draper and his detested
character,” Sterne wrote in the “Journal to Eliza”
on 17th April 1767, a few weeks after the lady
to whom it was addressed had sailed for India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span></p>

<p>Eliza is a figure so fascinating to the world
interested in the personal side of literary history
that a few pages may perhaps be devoted to tracing
her life after her acquaintance with Sterne. She
was undoubtedly an attractive woman, and made
conquest of others than the author of “Tristram
Shandy” during this visit to England. The Abbé
Raynal, a man about the same age as Sterne, fell
a victim to her charms, and expressed his passion
in a strange and wild piece of bombast, which he
inserted in the second edition of his “History of
the Indies.”</p>

<p>It was not only to men of middle age that
Mrs Draper appealed, for her cousin and playmate
of her youth, Thomas Mathew Sclater, was
one of her most devoted admirers. That she was
fascinating may be taken for granted, but wherein
lay her attractiveness is not so clear. Raynal laid
more stress on the qualities of her mind than on
her appearance. Sterne, too, by his own not too
artless confession, was in the first instance drawn
to her by something other than her good looks.</p>

<p>“I have just returned from our dear Mrs James’s,
where I have been talking of thee for three hours”
(he wrote to her when they had become well
acquainted). “She has got your picture, and likes
it; but Marriot, and some other judges, agree<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
that mine is the better, and expressive of a sweeter
character. But what is that to the original? yet
I acknowledge that hers is a picture for the
world, and mine is calculated only to please a
very sincere friend, or sentimental philosopher.&mdash;In
the one, you are dressed in smiles, and with
all the advantage of silks, pearls, and ermine;&mdash;in
the other, simple as a vestal&mdash;appearing the
good girl nature made you: which, to me,
conveys an idea of more unaffected sweetness,
than Mrs Draper, habited for conquest, in a birthday
suit, with her countenance animated, and her
dimples visible.&mdash;If I remember right, Eliza, you
endeavoured to collect every charm of your person
into your face, with more than <i>common</i> care, the
day you sat for Mrs James.&mdash;Your colour, too,
brightened; and your eyes shone with more than
usual brilliancy. I then requested you to come
simple and unadorned when you sat for me&mdash;knowing
(as I see with <i>unprejudiced</i> eyes) that you
could receive no addition from the silk-worm’s
aid, or jeweller’s polish. Let me now tell you
a truth, which, I believe, I have uttered before.
When I first saw you, I beheld you as an object
of compassion, and as a very plain woman. The
mode of your dress (though fashionable) disfigured
you. But nothing now could render you such,
but the being solicitous to make yourself admired<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
as a handsome one.&mdash;You are not handsome,
Eliza, nor is yours a face that will please the tenth
part of your beholders&mdash;but are something more;
for I scruple not to tell you, I never saw so intelligent,
so animated, so good a countenance;
nor was there (nor ever will be) that man of
sense, tenderness, and feeling, in your company
three hours, that was not (or will not be) your
admirer, or friend, in consequence of it; that is,
if you assume, or assumed, no character foreign
to your own, but appeared the artless being nature
designed you for. A something in your eyes, and
voice, you possess in a degree more persuasive than
any woman I ever saw, read, or heard of. But it
is that bewitching sort of nameless excellence that
men of nice sensibility alone can be touched with.”</p>

<p>While all are agreed that Mrs Draper had
beauty of expression rather than perfectly formed
features, there was given a description of her as
having “an appearance of artless innocence, a
transparent complexion, consequent upon delicate
health, but without any sallowness, brilliant eyes,
a melodious voice, an intellectual countenance,
unusually lighted up with much animation and
expressing a sweet gentleness of disposition.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span><span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
She had, we are told, engaging manners and
numerous accomplishments. She talked well and
wrote well, and could play the piano and the
guitar. Her faults were a tendency to pecuniary
extravagance and a liking for admiration&mdash;which
latter trait, in her correspondence, she admitted
and bewailed. She was also, it must be admitted,
a most arrant flirt.</p>

was a terrible blow to us at first, but use has in
some measure reconciled the mortifying change,<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
though we have no prospect of acquiring such an
independence here as will enable us to settle in
England for many, very many years, as the country
for some time has been the seat of war, and still
continues subject to frequent alarms from the
growing power of an ambitious usurper. I’ve no
doubt but a general massacre of the English will
ensue, if he once more visits this coast. Our
fortifications are a wretched burlesque upon such.
Troops not better soldiers than trained Bands, and
too few in number to cope with so able a general
and politician.</p>

<p>“I was within an hour once of being his prisoner,
and cannot say but I thought it a piece of good
fortune to escape that honour, though he has
promised to treat all English ladies well that
cheerfully submit to the laws of his seraglio. The
way of life I’m now in is quite new to me, but not
utterly unpleasant. I’m by turns the wife of a
Merchant, Soldier, and Innkeeper, for in such
different capacities is the Chief of Tellichery
destined to act. The War is a bar to Commerce,
yet I do a great deal of business in the mercantile
way, as my husband’s amanuensis. You know his
inability to use the pen, and as he has lost his
Clerks and Accountant, without any prospect of

supporting it creditably, what you would term
genteelly, though it does not defray the charge of
Liquors, which alone amount to six hundred a
year, and such a sum, vast as it seems, does not
seem extravagant in our situation. For we are
obliged to keep a public table, and six months in
the year have a full house of shipping Gentry,
that resort to us for traffic and intelligence from
all parts of India, China, and Asia. Our Society
at other times is very confined, as it only consists
of a few factors, and two or three families: and
such we cannot expect great intercourse with on

who’ve no notion of the difficulties they are to
encounter in the road to wealth, would not affect
me considerably, if I had not some very material
reasons for wishing to leave the Climate expeditiously.
My health is much prejudiced by a Residence
in it, my affection for an only child, strongly
induces me to bid farewell to it before it is too
late to benefit by a change of scene. Mr Draper
will in all probability be obliged to continue here
some years longer, but, as to myself, I hope to
be permitted to call myself an inhabitant of your
country before I am two years older.”</p>

<p class="tac width50 mt2em">MRS DRAPER TO MRS ANNE JAMES</p>

<p class="address">“<span class="smcap">Bombay</span>, <i>April 15th, 1772</i>.
</p>

<p>“You wonder, my dear, at my writing to Becket&mdash;I’ll
tell you why I did so. I have heard some
Anecdotes extremely disadvantageous to the Characters
of the Widow and Daughter [of Sterne],
and that from Persons who said they had been
personally acquainted with them, both in France
and England<span class="ell">...</span>. Some part of their Intelligence
corroborated what I had a thousand times
heard from the Lips of Yorick, almost invariably
repeated<span class="ell">...</span>. The Secret of my Letters
being in her hands, had somehow become extremely
Public: it was noticed to me by almost
every Acquaintance I had in the Ships, or at this
Settlement&mdash;this alarmed me, for at that time I
had never communicated the circumstance and
could not suspect you of acting by me in any
manner which I would not have acted in by
myself&mdash;One Gentleman in particular told me
that both you and I should be deceived, if
we had the least reliance on the Honor or
Principles of Mrs Sterne, for that, when she had
secured as much as she could for suppressing the
Correspondence she was capable of selling it to
a Bookseller afterwards&mdash;by either refusing to
return it to you&mdash;or taking Copies of it, without<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
our knowledge&mdash;and therefore He advised me, if I
was averse to its Publication, to take every means
in my Power of Suppressing it&mdash;this influenced
me to write to Becket and promise Him a reward
equal to his Expectations if He would deliver the
letters to you<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“My dear Friend, that stiffness you complain’d
of, when I called you Mrs James I said I could
not accost you with my usual Freedom entirely
arose from a Depression of Spirits, too natural
to the mortified, when severe Disappointments
gall the Sense&mdash;You had told me that Sterne was
no more&mdash;I had heard it before, but this Confirmation
of it truly afflicted me; for I was almost
an Idolator of his Worth, while I found Him the
Mild, Generous, Good Yorick, We had so often
thought Him to be&mdash;to add to my regret for his
loss his Widow had my letters in her Power (I
never entertained a good opinion of her), and
meant to subject me to Disgrace and Inconvenience
by the Publication of them. You know
not the contents of these letters, and it was
natural for you to form the worst judgment
of them, when those who had seen ’em reported
them unfavourably, and were disposed
to dislike me on that Account. My dear
girl! had I not cause to feel humbled so
Circumstanced&mdash;and can you wonder at my<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
sensations communicating themselves to my
Pen?</p>

<p>“Miss Sterne’s did indeed, my dear, give me a
great deal of pain&mdash;it was such a one as I by no
means deserved in answer to one written in the
true Spirit of kindness, however it might have
been constructed.&mdash;Mr Sterne had repeatedly
told me, that his Daughter was as well acquainted
with my Character as he was with my Appearance&mdash;in
all his letters wrote since my leaving
England this Circumstance is much dwelt upon.
Another, too, that of Mrs Sterne being in too
precarious a State of Health, to render it possible
that she would survive many months. Her violence
of temper (indeed, James, I wish not to
recriminate or be severe just now) and the hatefulness
of her Character, are strongly urged to
me, as the Cause of his Indifferent Health, the
whole of his Misfortunes, and the Evils that
would probably Shorten his Life&mdash;the visit Mrs
Sterne meditated, some time antecedent to his
Death, he most pathetically lamented, as an
adventure that would wound his Peace and
greatly embarrass his Circumstances&mdash;the former
on account of the Eye Witness He should be to
his Child’s Affections having been alienated from
Him by the artful Misrepresentations of her
Mother under whose Tutorage she had ever been&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>and
the latter, from the Rapacity of her Disposition&mdash;for
well do I know, says he, ‘that the
sole Intent of her Visit is to plague and fleece
me&mdash;had I Money enough, I would buy off this
Journey, as I have done several others&mdash;but till
my Sentimental Work is published I shall not
have a single sou more than will Indemnify People
for my immediate Expenses.’ The receipt of this
Intelligence I heard of Yorick’s Death. The very
first Ship which left us Afterwards, I wrote to
Miss Sterne by&mdash;and with all the freedom which
my Intimacy with her Father and his Communications
warranted&mdash;I purposely avoided speaking
of her Mother, for I knew nothing to her Advantage,
and I had heard a great deal to the
reverse&mdash;so circumstanced&mdash;how could I with
any kind of Delicacy Mention a Person who was
hateful to my departed Friend, when for the sake
of that very Friend I wished to confer a kindness
on his Daughter&mdash;and to enhance the value of it,
Solicited her Society and consent to share my
Prospects, as the highest Favor which could be
shown to Myself&mdash;indeed, I knew not, but Mrs
Sterne, from the Description I had received of
her, might be no more&mdash;or privately confined, if
in Being, owing to a Malady, which I have been
told the violence of her temper subjects her to.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span></p>

<p>It has been stated by many writers that the
cause of the unhappy life led by the Drapers at
Bombay was the fault of Sterne, whose insidious
flatteries undermined the lady’s moral rectitude.
This, not to put too fine a point on it, is a conclusion
as absurd as it is unwarrantable. Mrs
Draper was far too intelligent not to realise that
Sterne was a sentimentalist, and not to understand
that such allusions as to her being his second wife
were, if in bad taste, at least meant to be playful,
seeing that he was, and knew he was, standing
on the threshold of the valley of the shadow of
death. Mrs Draper left her husband six years
after she had said farewell to Sterne, not because
of the author’s influence on her, but because her
patience, weakened by a long course of unkind
behaviour, was finally outraged by her husband’s
obvious partiality for her maid, Mrs Leeds. She
had long desired to leave Draper, and now a
legitimate excuse was furnished, which in the
eyes of all unprejudiced persons justified the
step.</p>

<p>Draper, who seems to have had some suspicion
of her intention, watched her closely, and for a
while it was impossible for her to get away. At
last she escaped from Mazagon on board a King’s
cutter, and it was stated that she had eloped with
one of her admirers, Sir John Clark. The truth<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
was that she accepted his escort to the house
of her uncle, Thomas Whitehall, who lived
at Masulipatam.</p>


<p class="tac width50 mt2em">MRS DRAPER TO THOMAS MATHEW SCLATER</p>

<p class="address">

I live entirely with my uncle, and I shall continue
to do so to the last hour of my life if he continues
to wish it as much as he does at present.”</p>

<p>Whether her uncle did not continue to desire
her company, or whether she tired of the life,
cannot be determined, but later, in the year 1774,
Mrs Draper returned to England. There she took
up her friendship with the Jameses from the point
at which it had been interrupted by her departure
seven years earlier for India, and she was soon the
centre of a distinguished circle. The publication,
in 1775, of some of Sterne’s letters to her made
her somewhat unpleasantly notorious, and she
withdrew from London to the comparative seclusion
of Bristol, where she remained until her
death, three years later. She was buried in Bristol
Cathedral, where a monument, depicting two
classical figures bending over a shield, one bearing<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
a torch, the other a dove, was erected in her
honour. The shield bore the inscription:</p>

<h2>The Demoniacs</h2>

<p class="dropcap">’Twas at Jesus College, Cambridge,”
Sterne wrote in the last year of his
life, “I commenced a friendship with
Mr <span class="nowrap">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>, which has been most lasting on both
sides.” This “Mr <span class="nowrap">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>” was the notorious John
Hall, who added to his patronymic the name of
Stevenson after his marriage in 1739 with an heiress,
Anne, daughter of Ambrose Stevenson of Manor
House, in the parish of Lanchester, county Durham.
Born in 1718, the second son of Joseph Hall,
counsellor-at-law of Durham, by his wife,
Catherine, eldest daughter of Edward Trotter of
Skelton Castle, near Guisborough, John Hall-Stevenson,
to call him by the name by which he
is best known, went in his eighteenth year to
the University, for which, though he did not
there distinguish himself, he cherished to the end
of his days a sincere regard. “I should recommend
Cambridge as a place infinitely preferable to the
Temple,” he wrote to his eldest grandson, on
17th February 1785, “and particularly on account
of the connections you may form with young
gentlemen of your own age, of the first rank, men
that you must live with hereafter: it is the only
time of life to make lasting, honourable, and useful
friendships. These advantages were lost to me
and blasted by premature marriage, the scantiness
of my fortune forced me to vegetate in the country,<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
and precluded me from every laudable pursuit
suggested by ambition.”</p>

<p>The friendship between Sterne and Hall-Stevenson
must have been of rapid growth, as
Hall-Stevenson went to Jesus College in June
1835, and Sterne left the University when he
took his degree in the following January. Hall-Stevenson
has been, no doubt accurately, described
as a very precocious lad, with Rabelaisian tastes,
and again and again his influence with Sterne has
been made an excuse for the humorist’s lapses
from morality and decency. This, however, is
most unfair, for when the young men became
acquainted Hall-Stevenson was only seventeen
years of age, whereas Sterne was two-and-twenty.
Be this as it may, of their intimacy at this
time there is no doubt, and tradition tells how
they studied together&mdash;it would be interesting in
the light of subsequent events to know what they
studied. They called each other cousin, though
the relationship, if any, was most remote.
“Cousin Anthony Shandy,” Hall-Stevenson in
days to come signed himself, and Sterne, in the
famous dog-Latin letter written a few months
before he died, addressed him: “<i>mi consobrine,
consobrinis meis omnibus carior</i>.”</p>

<p>Hall-Stevenson remained at Cambridge until
1838, then went abroad for a year, and on his<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
return made the “premature marriage” to which
allusion has been made. When he and Sterne met
again is a problem not easy to solve. Sterne, writing
to Bishop Warburton in June 1760, mentioned that
he did not know Hall-Stevenson’s handwriting.
“From a nineteen years’ total interruption of all
correspondence with him,” he said, “I had forgot
his hand.” Since Sterne is so precise in giving
the number of years, it would seem as if he and
his college friend had written to each other until
1741, and that in this year the youthful intimacy,
after the manner of its kind, had lapsed. Probably
for some years they may have drifted apart, but
there is an abundance of evidence to show that
long before 1760 they were again on the best
terms.</p>

<p>The threads of the college friendship, it has
generally been stated, were gathered together
when Skelton Castle came into the possession
of Hall-Stevenson, who thenceforth resided
there. As to when this happened the writers
on Sterne only agree in remarking that it was
not until after 1745, in which year, after the
rebellion, Lawson Trotter, the owner of the
castle and a noted Jacobite, fled the country;
some say that then the property passed to his
sister, Hall-Stevenson’s mother, and at her death
to her son; others that it passed direct to the<span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
nephew as the next in tail. All these statements
are inaccurate. Lawson Trotter sold Skelton
Castle to Joseph Hall in 1727, and Hall-Stevenson,
his elder brother having died in
childhood, inherited the estate at the death of
his father six years later.</p>

<p>Skelton Castle, which is believed to date back
before the Conquest, had been added to, a square
tower here, a round tower there, by many of its
occupiers, Bruces, Cowpers, Trotters, until, when
it came into the hands of Hall-Stevenson, it was
a quaint patchwork edifice, erected on a platform
supported by two buttressed terraces, which raised
it high above the surrounding moat. Hall-Stevenson,
amused by the picture presented by
its medley of architectural styles, christened it
“Crazy Castle,” and wrote some humorous
verses descriptive of it, well worthy to be preserved,
especially as they are almost the only
lines from his pen that can be printed in this
respectable age:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span></p>

<p>Skelton Castle was at this date more than half
ruined, as the owner was at some pains to indicate:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hall-Stevenson was, as has been remarked, a
poor man, and could not afford to undertake the
task of repairing the vast structure, though once
he thought of making an effort to do so. When
Sterne heard of this he wrote protesting against
any interference with the fine old structure, and
seasoned his letter with a touch of worldly
wisdom that comes quaintly from him:</p>

<p>“But what art thou meditating with axes and
hammers?&mdash;‘<i>I know the pride and the naughtiness
of thy heart</i>,’ and thou lovest the sweet visions of
architraves, friezes and pediments with their
tympanums, and thou hast found out a pretence,
<i>à raison de cinq livres sterling</i> to be laid out in four
years, &amp;c. &amp;c. (so as not to be felt, which is
always added by the d&mdash;&mdash;l as a bait) to justify
thyself unto thyself. It may be very wise to do<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
this&mdash;but ’tis wiser to keep one’s money in one’s
pocket, whilst there are wars without and rumours
of wars within. St &mdash;&mdash; advises his disciples to
sell both coat and waistcoat&mdash;and go rather without
shirt or sword, than leave no money in their
scrip to go to Jerusalem with. Now those <i>quatre
ans consecutifs</i>, my dear Anthony, are the most
precious morsels in thy <i>life to come</i> (in this world),
and thou wilt do well to enjoy that morsel without
cares, calculations, and curses, and damns, and
debts&mdash;for as sure as stone is stone, and mortar is
mortar, &amp;c., ’twill be one of the many works of
thy repentance.&mdash;But after all, if the Fates have
decreed it, as you and I have some time supposed
it on account of your generosity, ‘<i>that you
are never to be a monied man</i>,’ the decree will be
fulfilled whether you adorn your castle and line
it with cedar, and paint it within side and without
side with vermilion, or not&mdash;<i>et cela étant</i> (having
a bottle of Frontiniac and glass at my right hand)
I drink, dear Anthony, to thy health and happiness,
and to the final accomplishments of all thy
lunary and sublunary projects.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this sage counsel, Hall-Stevenson
called in an architect, presently to
be referred to as “Don Pringello,” who, to his
credit, declined to tamper with the building, and<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
succeeded in inducing the owner to abandon the
plan of reconstruction.</p>

<p>Hall-Stevenson from time to time visited
London, and made acquaintance with Horace
Walpole, and also with Sir Francis Dashwood
and John Wilkes, who introduced him to the
Monks of Medmenham and also gave him a taste
for politics, that afterwards found vent in some
satirical verses. Lack of means, however, prevented
his taking any considerable part in metropolitan
gaieties, and he lived most of his life on
his estate, making an occasional stay at Scarborough
or some other northern watering-place.
At Skelton, as William Hutton phrased it happily,
he “kept a full-spread board, and wore down the
steps of his cellar.” Steeped in Rabelaisian literature,
he caught something of the spirit of the
books he had perused; and, inspired by the example
of the deceased Duke of Wharton and of
his friend Dashwood, he gathered round him a
body of men with similar tastes, and founded, in
imitation of the Hell-fire Club and the Monks
of Medmenham, a society which has passed into
history as the Demoniacs.</p>

<p>The number of members of this convivial
community cannot have been considerable. Hall-Stevenson
in “Crazy Tales” gives eleven stories,
each supposed to have been told by one of the<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
band, the identity of the narrator being veiled
under a nickname; and if this may be accepted
as a guide, then there were but eleven Demoniacs
in 1862&mdash;though, in a later edition, were added,
“Old Hewett’s Tale,” and “Tom of Colesby’s
Tale.” In most cases it has been easy to discover
the names of the members. “Anthony” of the
“Crazy Tale” was, of course, the host; and
“My Cousin” Sterne, though he was also known
among the fraternity as “The Blackbird,” probably
because of his clerical attire, and under this
<i>sobriquet</i> was made the subject of one of Hall-Stevenson’s
“Makarony Fables.” “Zachary” was
Zachary Moore, of Lofthouse, a fashionable man
about town, who spent a great fortune in riotous
living; though the only story of his extravagance
that has been handed down is, that his horses
were always shod with silver, and that when a
shoe fell off or was loose, he would have it replaced
with a new one. He was a jovial fellow,
and popular.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“What sober heads hath thou made ache!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">How many hath thou kept from nodding!</div>
<div class="verse">How many wise ones, for thy sake,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Have flown to thee, and left off plodding.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus he was apostrophised by Hall-Stevenson,
who subsequently indited an epitaph for him,<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
which while it does much credit to the writer’s
heart, does less to his head: such a prodigal as
Moore was lucky to be presented with an ensigncy.</p>

<p>“Z.&nbsp;M. Esq.” (thus runs the epitaph), “A Living
Monument, of the Friendship and Generosity
of the Great; After an Intimacy of Thirty Years
With most of The Great Personages of these
Kingdoms, Who did him the Honour to assist
him, In the laborious Work, Of getting to the
far End of a great Fortune; These his Noble
Friends, From Gratitude For the many happy
Days and Nights Enjoyed by his means, Exalted
him, through their Influence, In the forty-seventh
year of his Age, To an Ensigncy; which he actually
enjoys at present at Gibraltar.”</p>

<p>The “Privy Counsellor” of the “Tales” has
been said to be Sir Francis Dashwood, but upon
what grounds this statement has been made is not
clear: if the assumption is accurate, the “Privy
Counsellor” cannot often have attended the gatherings
of the brethren, being usually otherwise engaged
in London. “Panty,” an abbreviation of
Pantagruel, is known to have been the Rev.
Robert Lascelles, subsequently the incumbent of
Gilling, in the West Riding; and “Don Pringello,”<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
whose name has not transpired<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> has his niche in
“Tristram Shandy,” where it is mentioned: “I
am this moment in a handsome pavilion built by
Pringello upon the banks of the Garonne.” Don
Pringello also receives honourable mention in a
scholium to the Tale inscribed to his name by
“Cousin Anthony.”</p>

<p>“Don Pringello” (Hall-Stevenson wrote) “was
a celebrated Spanish Architect, of unbounded
generosity. At his own expense, on the other
side of the Pyrenean Mountains, he built many
noble castles, both for private people and for the
<i>public</i>, out of his own funds; he repaired several
palaces, situated upon the pleasant banks of that
delightful river, the Garonne, in France, and came
over on purpose to rebuild <span class="smcap">Crazy-Castle</span>; but,
struck with its venerable remains, he could
only be prevailed upon to add a few ornaments,
suitable to the stile and taste of the age it was
built in.”</p>

<p>“Old Hewett” was that eccentric William
Hewett, or Hewitt, introduced into “Humphrey<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
Clinker” by Smollett, who prophesied that, “his
exit will be as odd as his life has been extravagant.”
Smollett’s anticipation was justified, even
before the novel was published, as the author
mentions in a footnote. Hewett in 1767, being
then over seventy years of age, was attacked by
an internal complaint, and, to quote Smollett,</p>

<p>“he resolved to take himself off by abstinence;
and this resolution he executed like an ancient
Roman. He saw company to the last, cracked
his jokes, conversed freely, and entertained his
guests with music. On the third day of his fast,
he found himself entirely freed from his complaint;
but refused taking sustinence. He said the
most disagreeable part of the journey was past,
and he should be a cursed fool indeed to put about
ship when he was just entering the harbour. In
these sentiments he persisted, without any marks
of affectation; and thus finished his course with
such ease and serenity, as would have done honour
to the firmest stoic of antiquity.”</p>

<p>There are still unaccounted for, “Captain
Shadow,” “The Student of Law,” “The Governor
of Txlbury,” “The Lxxb,” “The Poet,” and
“Tom of Colesby”; and against these may be
placed other frequenters of Skelton Castle&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>though
it is possible some may not have been
of the brotherhood. There were Garland, a
neighbouring squire; and Scroope, whom Sterne
referred to as “Cardinal S.” and who was probably
a parson; and “G.” of the printed letters,
whose name in the originals is given as Gilbert.
More likely to have been Demoniacs were Hall-Stevenson’s
younger brother, Colonel George
Lawson Hall (who married a daughter of Lord
William Manners), and Andrew Irvine, called
by his familiars “Paddy Andrews,” master of the
Grammar School at Kirkleatham. Because Dr
Alexander Carlyle met at Harrogate in the company
of Hall-Stevenson that Charles Lee who
subsequently became a general in the American
army, and fought against his countrymen in the
War of Independence, Lee has been written
down one of the society; but it is improbable he
was enrolled, if only because, leaving England in
1751 at the age of twenty, he was not again in
his native land before “Crazy Tales” was written,
except for a few months in the spring of 1761.</p>

<p>The Demoniacs (and the title may for the
nonce be taken to include all the frequenters of
Skelton Castle) have been damned by each succeeding
writer who has taken them for his subject;
but it is extremely doubtful if they were as black
as they have been painted. Had they been merely<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
vulgar debauchees, it is inconceivable that Sterne
would have let them make the acquaintance, not
only of his wife, but also of the young daughter
he cherished so tenderly; and it is only one
degree less unlikely that they would have won
and retained his affectionate regard for a score
of years, or that he would have read to them
“Tristram Shandy” and have desired their
opinion of the various instalments of that
work. His letters are full of references to the
Demoniacs, and he rarely wrote to “dear Cousin
Anthony” without sending greetings to his
associates, and expressing the wish that he was
with them.</p>

<p>“Greet the Colonel [Hall] in my name, and
thank him cordially from me for his many
civilities to Madame and Mademoiselle Sterne,
who send all due acknowledgments” (he wrote
from Toulouse, 12th August 1762; adding in a
postscript:) “Oh! how I envy you all at Crazy
Castle! I would like to spend a month with you&mdash;and
should return back again for the vintage<span class="ell">...</span>.
Now farewell&mdash;remember me to my beloved
Colonel&mdash;greet Panty most lovingly on my
behalf, and if Mrs <span class="nowrap">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Miss <span class="nowrap">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>, &amp;c.
are at G[uisborough], greet them likewise with
a holy kiss&mdash;So God bless you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span></p>

<p>A couple of months later, Sterne, still at
Toulouse, addressed Hall-Stevenson:</p>

<p>“If I had nothing to stop me I would engage
to set out this morning, and knock at Crazy Castle
gates in three days less time&mdash;by which time I
should find you and the Colonel, Panty, &amp;c. all
alone&mdash;the season I most wish and like to be
with you.”</p>

<p>Again and again are allusions to the Crazelites,
as Sterne often called them:</p>

<p>“I send all compliments to Sir C. D[ashwoo]d
and <span class="nowrap">G&mdash;&mdash;</span>s. I love them from my soul. If G[ilber]t
is with you, him also” (he wrote from Coxwold,
4th September 1764; and from Naples, two
years later:). “Give my kind services to my friends&mdash;especially
to the household of faith&mdash;my dear
Garland&mdash;to the worthy Colonel&mdash;to Cardinal
S[croope], and to my fellow-labourer Pantagruel.”</p>

<p>Even in the last year of his life he looked
forward to being present at a reunion at the castle:
“We shall all meet from the east, and from the
south, and (as at the last) be happy together.”</p>

<p>Faults the Demoniacs certainly had; but there
is no reason to believe, indeed there is not a jot
or tittle of evidence to support the suggestion,
that they performed the blasphemous rites as<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>sociated
with the more famous institutions that
served as their model. Their indulgences were
limited to coarse stories and deep potations;
which, after all, were regarded as venial sins in
the eighteenth century. Even so, of course, it
must be admitted they were not fit company for
clergymen, and it is a matter for regret that Sterne
should have been of the party. Doubtless Laurence
told his story of “A Cock and a Bull” with the
best of them; but he was no drunkard, and tried
to induce Hall-Stevenson to give up the habit of
heavy drinking.</p>

<p>“If I was you, quoth Yorick, I would drink
more water, Eugenius” (so runs a passage in
“Tristram Shandy”). “And, if I was you, Yorick,
replied Eugenius, so would I.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, several of the Demoniacs
were men of intelligence. With all his vices,
Dashwood had brains of no mean order; Irvine,
the schoolmaster, and a Cambridge D.D., had,
at least, some reading; and Lascelles, a keen fisherman,
could write verses&mdash;not very good verses,
it is true&mdash;in Latin and English. It is doubtful,
however, if he was that Robert Lascelles who
in 1811 wrote the “Letters on Sporting,” in
which he treated of angling, shooting, and cours<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>ing;
although this rare work has been attributed
to him. William Hewett, too, was a cultured
man; he had been tutor to the Marquis of Granby,
and was a friend of Voltaire. He had a pretty wit.
It has been told how being in the Campidoglio at
Rome, Hewett, who owned “no religion but
that of nature,” made up to the bust of Jupiter,
and, bowing very low, exclaimed in the Italian
language, “I hope, sir, if ever you get your head
above water again, you will remember that I paid
my respects to you in your adversity.” Indeed that
carousals at Skelton Castle were confined to the
evening is shown by Hall-Stevenson’s account of
his guest’s occupations during the day.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Some fell to fiddling, some to fluting,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Some to shooting, some to fishing,</div>
<div class="verse">Some to pishing and disputing,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Or to computing by wishing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And in the evening when they met</div>
<div class="verse indent2">(To think on’t always does me good,)</div>
<div class="verse">There never met a jollier sett,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Either before, or since the Flood.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nor was Hall-Stevenson a mere voluptuary.
Even though the critic may have exaggerated
who wrote of him: “He could engage in the
grave discussions of criticism and literature with
superior power; he was qualified to enliven<span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
general society with the smile of Horace, the
laughter of Cervantes; or he could sit on Fontaine’s
easy chair, and unbosom his humour to his chosen
friends”; yet there is no doubt that he was a good
classical scholar, and, for an Englishman, exceptionally
well read in the <i>belles lettres</i> of Europe,
in a day when such knowledge was rare.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“<span class="smcap">Anthony</span>, Lord of <span class="smcap">Crazy</span> Castle,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Neither a fisher, nor a shooter,</div>
<div class="verse">No man’s, but any woman’s vassel,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">If he could find a way to suit her”;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>so he wrote himself down; and the description
is good so far as it goes. But though “My Cousin
Anthony” thus indicates that, unlike Sterne, he
has no liking for field sports, he does not mention
that he found his pleasure at home in the great
library, that was so rich in what Bagehot has described
as “old folio learning and the amatory reading
of other days.” There the owner browsed for
hours together, and he wrought better than he
knew when he introduced his friend Sterne to
the apartment and made him free of it, for there
it was that Sterne found in many quaint forgotten
volumes much of that strange lore with which
the elder Shandy’s mind was packed. Dr Carlyle
found Hall-Stevenson a “highly-accomplished
and well-bred gentleman,” and Sterne’s opinion<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
of his old college friend is clearly shown not only
in his letters but in the character of “Eugenius”
in “Tristram Shandy.” There must have been
virtues in the man who stood for Eugenius, else
Sterne, who had as keen an eye for the weaknesses
of his fellows as any author that ever lived,
would not have immortalised him as the wise,
kindly counsellor of Yorick. How tenderly Sterne
rallied “Cousin Anthony” upon his hypochondria.</p>

<p>“And so you think this [letter] cursed stupid&mdash;but
that, my dear H., depends much upon the
quotâ horâ of your shabby clock, if the pointer
of it is in any quarter between ten in the morning
or four in the afternoon&mdash;I give it up&mdash;or if the
day is obscured by dark engendering clouds of
either wet or dry weather, I am still lost&mdash;but
who knows but it be five&mdash;and the day as fine a
day as ever shone upon the earth since the destruction
of Sodom&mdash;and peradventure your honour
may have got a good hearty dinner to-day, and
eat and drink your intellectuals into a placidulish
and blandulish amalgama&mdash;to bear nonsense, so
much for that.”</p>

<p>So he wrote from Coxwould in August 1761;
and rather more than a year later, when he was
at Toulouse, he reverted to the subject:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span></p>

<p>“I rejoice from my heart, down to my reins, that
you have snatched so many happy and sunshiny
days out of the hands of the blue devils. If we live to
meet and join our forces as heretofore, we will give
these gentry a drubbing&mdash;and turn them for ever
out of their usurped citadel&mdash;some legions of them
have been put to flight already by your operations
this last campaign&mdash;and I hope to have a hand
in dispersing the remainder the first time my dear
cousin sets up his banners again under the square
tower.”</p>

<p>Once, indeed, Sterne tried to cure his friend.
Hall-Stevenson had a great fear of the effect of
the east wind upon his health, and he had a
weather-cock placed so that he could see it from
the window of his room, and he would consult
it every morning. When the wind blew from
that quarter he would not get up, or, being up,
would retire to bed. During one of Sterne’s
visits to Skelton Castle he bribed a lad to climb
up one night and tie the vane to the west; and
Hall-Stevenson, after the customary inspection of
the weather-cock, joined his guests the next day
without any ill effect, although as a matter of
fact an east wind was blowing. The trick was
subsequently explained; but it is doubtful if it
cured the <i>malade imaginaire</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span></p>

<p>Hall-Stevenson was as devoted to Sterne as
Sterne to him, and he made agreeable reference
to their affection:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“In this retreat, whilom so sweet,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Once <i>Tristram</i> and his cousin dwelt,</div>
<div class="verse">They talk of <i>Crazy</i> when they meet,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">As if their tender hearts would melt.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the first two volumes of “Tristram
Shandy” were published, Hall-Stevenson indicted
a lyric epistle “To my Cousin Shandy, on
his coming to Town,” that, through its indecency,
brought in its train more annoyance than pleasure
to Sterne; and subsequently (in 1768) parodied
the style of the book under the title of “A Sentimental
Dialogue between two Souls in the Palpable
Bodies of an English Lady of Quality and
an Irish Gentleman,” introduced by a note:
“Tristram Shandy presents his compliments to
the Gentlemen of Ireland, and begs their acceptance
of a Sentimental Offering, as an acknowledgment
due to the Country where he was born.”
A year after Sterne’s death Hall-Stevenson, over
the signature of “Eugenius,” issued a continuation
of “A Sentimental Journey,” for which he made
the following excuse:</p>

<p>“The Editor has compiled this Continuation of
his Sentimental Journey, from such motives, and<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
upon such authority, as he flatters himself will
form a sufficient apology to his readers for its
publication.</p>

<p>“The abrupt manner in which the Second
Volume concluded, seemed forcibly to claim a
sequel; and doubtless if the author’s life had
been spared, the world would have received it
from his own hand, as he had materials already
prepared. The intimacy which subsisted between
Mr Sterne and the Editor, gave the latter frequent
occasion of hearing him relate the most remarkable
incidents of the latter part of his last journey,
which made such an impression on him, that he
thinks he has retained them so perfectly as to be
able to commit them to paper. In doing this, he
has endeavoured to imitate his friends stile and
manner, but how far he has been successful in
this respect, he leaves the reader to determine.
The work may now, however, be considered as
complete; and the remaining curiosity of the
readers of Yorick’s Sentimental Journey, will at
least be gratified with respect to facts, events, and
observations.”</p>

<p>The book opens with an apostrophe to his
dead friend:</p>

<p>“Delightful Humourist! thine were unaccountable
faculties. Thy Muse was the Muse of<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
joy and sorrow,&mdash;of sorrow and joy. Thou didst so
exquisitely blend fancy with feeling, mirth with
misfortune; thy laughter was so laughable; and
thy sighs so sad; that&mdash;thou never wast, never
will be equalled.&mdash;Thou hadst the <i>Key of the
Heart</i>.&mdash;Lend it to a Friend.</p>

<p>“O Yorick, hear me! <i>Half</i> thy work is left
unfinished, and <i>all</i> thy spirit is fled.&mdash;Send part
of it back. Drop one remnant of it to a Friend.”</p>

<p>The prayer was not granted. The mantle of
Yorick did not fall upon Eugenius, who had
neither the power of humour or pathos, but only
the indelicacy a hundredfold increased, of the
great man. Indeed, the writings of Hall-Stevenson
rendered poor service to his friends, for it was
their publication that brought about the forcible
condemnation of the Demoniacs: the flagrant
indecency of “Crazy Tales” being accepted as
a clue to the thoughts and actions of the members
of the society. Yet of that little production, which
appeared in 1762, the author thought very highly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“As long as <span class="smcap">Crazy</span> Castle lasts,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Their Tales will never be forgot,</div>
<div class="verse">And <span class="smcap">Crazy</span> may stand many blasts,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And better Castles go to pot.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus Hall-Stevenson in his Prologue, doubtless
reflecting that since Skelton Castle had endured<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
through seven centuries, it might well brave the
breeze for many generations to come. His prophecy
was not falsified, for “Crazy Tales” were
not forgot until the Castle went to pot&mdash;which
event, however, took place three years after his
death, when his grandson substituted for the
unique and picturesque structure a house in
which it was possible to live in comfort. Nay,
the “Tales” outlived the Castle, being reprinted
in 1796, and again four and twenty years later,
when they were assigned on the title-page to
Sheridan. A glance at the catalogue of the British
Museum Library shows that some singularly ill-advised
person thought fit in 1896 to reissue the
book for private circulation.</p>

<p>That Sterne should find a word of praise for
“Crazy Tales” was but natural:</p>

<p>“I honour the man who has given the world an
idea of our parental seat&mdash;’tis well done&mdash;I look
at it ten times a day with a <i>quando te aspiciam</i>”
(he wrote to his friend from Toulouse soon after
the publication of the volume; adding), “I felicitate
you upon what messr. the Reviewers allow
you&mdash;they have too much judgment themselves
not to allow you what you are actually possessed
of, ‘talents, wit, and humour.’&mdash;Well, write on,
my dear cousin, and be guided by thy fancy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span></p>

<p>It is more surprising to find Horace Walpole
enlisting himself among Hall-Stevenson’s admirers.
“They entertained me extremely,” he
wrote to a friend, returning some verses, “as
Mr Hall’s works always do. He has a vast deal
of original humour and wit, and nobody admires
him more than I do<span class="ell">...</span>. If all authors had as
much parts and good sense as he has, I should
not be so sick of them as I am.” The critics as a
body were not so kind, and incurred the resentment
of the author, who lashed them in “Two
Lyric Epistles,” which Gray, writing to the Rev.
James Brown,thought “seemed to be absolute madness.”
The works, which were collected in 1795,
were declared by Sir Walter Scott to be witty;
but even that tribute has since been denied them.
Bagehot dismissed them as having “licence without
humour, and vice without amusement,” and
Whitwell Elwin, in his masterly essay on Sterne,
stigmatised the “Crazy Tales” as infamous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span></p>
<h2>William Beckford of Fonthill Abbey</h2>


<p class="dropcap">It may be said with truth that there were
few famous men born in the eighteenth
century of whom less is known than of
William Beckford of Fonthill, the author of
“Vathek.” There is an abundance of legend, as
little trustworthy as most legends, but of the
man as he was few people have even a remote
conception. This may be partly because there
has been no biography of him worthy of the
name; but it is, probably, due even more largely
to the fact that he led a secluded life. It is certain
that stories concerning him, invariably defamatory
and usually libellous, were circulated so far back
as the days of his minority; and that these were
revived when, after his Continental tours, he
settled at Fonthill. Then the air of mystery
that enveloped him created grave suspicion in
the minds of his fox-hunting neighbours. Everything
he said was misrepresented and regarded as
evidence against him, until so strong was the
feeling that it was looked upon by his country
neighbours as disgraceful to visit him. This,
however, did not prevent Nelson or Sam Rogers
or Sir William Hamilton from going to Fonthill,
nor, later, did it prevent his acquaintance with
Benjamin Disraeli. Notwithstanding, Beckford
was accused of almost every conceivable crime,
and John Mitford, in one of his unpublished<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
note-books, solemnly recorded that Beckford
was accused of poisoning his wife at Cintra.
There was no more truth in any other accusation
than in this of causing the death of a woman
to whom he was deeply attached and whose loss
he sincerely mourned. Thirty years after her
death, Rogers noticed that there were tears in
Beckford’s eyes while he was talking of her.</p>

<p>This, however, was but one of many slanders.
It was said that Beckford built the high wall
round his estate of Fonthill that his orgies might
be carried on unperceived&mdash;the wall was built
because no mere request would keep the hunters
off his land, and he could not bear to see the
death agonies of a fox. It was said that he kept
a number of dwarfs, and with their aid performed
blasphemous rites and indulged in magical incantations&mdash;he
had in his service one dwarf,
Piero, whom he had rescued in some Italian
town from a cruel father. Even so recently as
nine years ago an anonymous writer thought it
worth while to record in a literary journal the
reminiscences of an elderly lady, who lived at
Bath when Beckford resided in that city, who
was a child then, and who had no acquaintance
with him. This elderly lady stated that “a species
of paroxysm would seize Beckford if he saw a
woman”&mdash;yet a line before she speaks of his<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
riding through the streets of Bath! Were the
women of Bath on these occasions, it is legitimate
to ask, commanded, like the inhabitants of
Coventry when Lady Godiva took her famous
airing, to keep out of sight? or was Beckford
seen to have paroxysm after paroxysm as his
horse took him through the narrow streets of
the quaint old city? The same authority relates
that at Beckford’s house in Lansdown Crescent
(Bath) niches were constructed in the walls of
the staircase, so that the female servants could
conceal themselves when they heard their master’s
footsteps; and that one girl, to satisfy her curiosity
as to what Beckford would do if he saw her, had
her curiosity fully satisfied, for the “woman-hater,
in a paroxysm of fury, seized her by the
waist and threw her over the banisters.” This suggests
a new version of the Peeping Tom episode,
and also brings to mind the nursery rhyme,</p>

<p class="tac">“He took her by the left leg and threw her down the stairs.”
</p>

<p>It is pleasant to be told that the misogynist
generously bestowed on the injured maid a
pension for life. The story is nearly as good,
and doubtless quite as true, as that of the gentleman
who killed a waiter at an inn and told the
landlord, who thought he must send for the police,
to charge it in the bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span></p>

<p>The fact is that the majority of writers on Beckford
have been willing to recount what they have
heard, without making any attempt at verification,
even when such a task would not have been difficult.
Beckford, we are told, was as likely to thrash
a beggar in the streets as to give him alms. This
is really the most truthful of all the charges
brought against him, for it actually has for its
foundation the fact that he once did strike a
beggar! Here is the story: When Beckford was
riding one day to Weston, a suburb of Bath, a
man near his gates begged from him and received
a coin; delighted with his success, the beggar
watched which way the donor was going, took
a short cut, and at another place again asked for
alms, only to be recognised and struck with a
whip.</p>

<p>The calumnies that pursued Beckford during
his life, and his memory since his death, were
bad enough, but the excuses that are made for
him nowadays are worse. The writer already
referred to as retailing the elderly lady’s gossip,
unable to account for Beckford’s mysterious
seclusion and other peculiarities, fell back upon
the convenient suggestion of “a mental derangement.”
“We learn,” he said, in support of his
contention, “that at his death he showed scarcely
a sign of age, a peculiarity frequently noticed, of
course, among those with similar mental aberrations.”
Another peculiarity frequently noticed,
among those with similar mental aberrations, we
may add, is that at their death many show every
sign of age.</p>

<img src="images/illus_205.jpg" width="360" height="477" alt="" />
<div><p class="tac fs120"><i>William Beckford</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Many of those who do not suggest that Beckford
was mad love to dwell upon his eccentricities;
but an examination of their arguments
shows that these eccentricities were limited to
the building of Fonthill and a love of seclusion.
His seclusion has been vastly exaggerated, and
Fonthill was but the whim of a millionaire&mdash;a
whim, moreover, prompted by a laudable desire
to provide employment for the poor of the
countryside. What a genius he had “Vathek”
proves conclusively; how sane he was to the end
of his days may be discerned from the letters
written in the last years, even in the last month,
of his long life.</p>

<p>The keynote of Beckford’s character was enthusiasm.
If he undertook anything it must be
done forthwith; if he had a desire, he must
satisfy it with the least possible delay. Thus,
when he built Fonthill he had five hundred men
working day and night; when he collected books,
he did so with such vigour that in a few years he
brought together one of the finest private libraries
in the world. That last passion never deserted him,<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
and in his eighty-fourth year he studied catalogues
as keenly, and was as impatient for news as to the
success that had attended his agent, as when he
began half-a-century earlier. Like most men he
did not suffer bores gladly, but, unlike the
majority, he would not have aught to do with
them. Having a genius and a million, he lived
his life as he pleased; while welcoming his
friends, and opening wide his doors to distinguished
writers, artists and musicians, he held
the rest of the world at bay, and spent his days
with his books and pictures, playing the piano,
and superintending his gardens. So well did he
order his life that when in his eighty-fifth year
the flame was burning out, he could say truthfully,
“I have never known a moment’s <i>ennui</i>.”</p>

<p>Beckford was born with a silver spoon in his
mouth. Wealth came to him from his father, the
Alderman, and aristocratic connections from his
mother, the daughter and co-heir of the Hon.
George Hamilton, second surviving son of the
Sixth Earl of Abercorn. Lord Chatham was his
godfather, and when the Alderman died in 1770,
not only did Lord Chatham, but also “the good
Lord Lyttelton” and Lord Camden, interest
themselves in the education of the ten-years-old
lad, who, if he lived to attain his majority, would
be the wealthiest commoner in England. The<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
Rev. John Lettice was his tutor; Sir William
Chambers, who was then rebuilding Somerset
House, taught him architecture; and he studied
music under Mozart. He learnt declamation, too,
and at an early age won the approval of his godfather
by reciting with correct emphasis a passage
from Thucydides which he had previously translated
into English. “May you,” the aged statesman
said to his son William, “some day make as
brilliant a speaker.” The cynical may trace from
this remark the dislike that subsequently existed
between the younger Pitt and Beckford.</p>

<p>“Great pains were bestowed upon my education,”
Beckford said in his old age. “I was living
amidst a fine collection of works of art, under
competent tutors. I was studious and diligent
from inclination. I was fond of reading whatever
came in my way. After my classical studies were
finished, and while I worked hard at Persian, I read
French and English biographies of all sorts.” How
much he profited by his education, and how well
he remembered what he read, is shown conclusively
by the numerous allusions to men and
books in the letters written when he was still a
lad. He seems, indeed, to have been taught, or to
have acquired by reading, some knowledge of
most subjects, except, as he subsequently admitted
regretfully, astronomy. Like most boys, he pre<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>ferred
the subjects of his own choosing to those
he was compelled to study. A chance discussion
as to whether the Abercorn branch of the
Hamilton family from which his mother was
descended was older than the ducal branch sent
him early to books of genealogy, and his reading
in this byway of history imbued him with a pride
of race that nothing could eradicate. His father’s
ancestry did not satisfy him, and he studied the
pedigree of his mother, and declared he could
trace it to John of Gaunt. He claimed the distinction
of being descended from all the barons
(of whom any issue remained) who signed Magna
Charta. At a very early age he came across a copy
of “The Arabian Nights”&mdash;and this chance find
had more effect upon his life and character than
any other incident. He read and re-read these
stories with avidity, and the impression they
made on him was so strong that Lord Chatham
instructed Lettice that the book must be kept from
the boy. The precaution came too late, for, though
the injunction was obeyed and for some years
“The Arabian Nights” was withheld from him,
the Oriental tales had taken possession of the
impressionable reader to such an extent that he
could never forget them. They had fired his
youthful mind and held his imagination captive;
their influence over him never waned all the days<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
of his life; and while they inspired him with the
idea of “Vathek,” they also fostered in him the
love of magnificence, inherited from his father,
that resulted in the erection of Fonthill Abbey
and other extravagances. As a lad, owing to the
hold the stories had over him, he became a
dreamer and lived in an unreal world; and it is
not surprising, therefore, that, though of an
amiable disposition, he became wilful and capricious.
“Little Beckford was really disappointed
at not being in time to see you&mdash;a good mark
for my young <i>vivid</i> friend,” Lord Chatham wrote
to William Pitt, 9th October 1773. “He is just
as much compounded of the elements of <i>air and
fire</i> as he was. A due proportion of <i>terrestrial</i>
solidity will, I trust, come and make him
perfect.”</p>

<p>A boy of thirteen who is all “air and fire” is
certain to be spoilt by a doting mother and made
much of by visitors to the house, and Beckford’s
wit was so much encouraged by almost all of
them that, in spite of Lettice’s admonitions, he
frequently got out of hand. Only his relative, the
old Duchess of Queensberry&mdash;Gay’s Duchess&mdash;who
lived in the neighbourhood, ventured to rebuke
him: when he treated her with some lack
of respect at her house, without making any
reply, she sent a servant for the great family<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
Bible, and made the boy read a passage from the
Book of Solomon: “There it was, young man,
that I learnt <i>my</i> manners,” she said impressively;
“I hope you will remember what you have
read.”</p>

<p>Mrs Beckford had refused to allow her son to
go to school, and she objected as strongly to send
him to a university, regarding the temptations
that would there be held out to a young man of
enormous wealth as more than counterbalancing
the advantages. Eventually it was decided that
the lad, now in his seventeenth year, should stay
with his relatives, Colonel and Miss Hamilton,
who lived at Geneva. Though for the first time
emancipated from maternal control, Beckford,
happy in his daydreams, showed no desire to
kick over the traces. It was at this time that
Beckford first gave expression to his intention to
adopt a mode of life different from that led by
most fashionable young men.</p>

<p>“To receive Visits and to return them, to be
mighty civil, well-bred, quiet, prettily Dressed,
and smart is to be what your old Ladies call in
England a charming Gentleman, and what those
of the same stamps abroad know by the appellation
of <i>un homme comme il faut</i>. Such an Animal
how often am I doomed to be” (he wrote at the<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
age of seventeen, in a letter hitherto unpublished).
“To pay and to receive fulsome Compliments from
the Learned, to talk with modesty and precision,
to sport an opinion gracefully, to adore Buffon
and d’Alembert, to delight in Mathematics,
logick, Geometry, and the rule of Right, the
<i>mal morale</i> and the <i>mal physique</i>, to despise poetry
and venerable Antiquity, murder Taste, abhor
imagination, detest all the charms of Eloquence
unless capable of mathematical Demonstration,
and more than all, to be vigorously incredulous,
is to gain the reputation of good sound Sense.
Such an Animal I am sometimes doomed to be. To
glory in Horses, to know how to knock up and
how to cure them, to smell of the stable, swear,
talk bawdy, eat roast beef, drink, speak bad
French, go to Lyons, and come back again with
manly disorders, are qualifications not despicable
in the Eyes of the English here. Such an Animal
I am determined not to be.”</p>

<p>After a year and a half’s absence Beckford was
summoned to England, where he stayed for some
months, visiting various cities and country houses,
and composing his first book, “Biographical
Memoirs of Extraordinary Painters.” It was well
in keeping with the curious contradictions of
Beckford’s character, that, while his letters before<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
and after, and even while he was engaged upon
the “Memoirs,” were so full of dreams, this work
should be an amusing burlesque. “I will explain
the origin of the ‘Memoirs,’&#8239;” Beckford said to
Cyrus Redding in 1835, fifty-five years after its
publication. “The housekeeper at old Fonthill,
as is customary, used to get her fee by exhibiting
the pictures to those who came to see the building.
Once or twice I heard her give the most extraordinary
names to different artists. I wondered how
such nonsense could enter the brain of woman.
More than this, in her conceit she would at times
expatiate upon excellencies of which the picture
before her had no trace. The temptation was irresistible
in my humour. I was but seventeen. My
pen was quickly in hand composing the ‘Memoirs.’
In future the housekeeper had a printed guide in
aid of her descriptions. She caught up my phrases;
the fictitious names of the wives, too, whom I
had given to my imaginary painters, were soon
learned in addition; her descriptions became
more picturesque, her language more graphic
than ever, to the sight-seeing people. Mine was
the text-book, whoever exhibited the paintings.
The book was soon on the tongues of all the
domestics. Many were the quotations current
upon the merits of Og of Basan and Watersouchy
of Amsterdam. Before a picture of Rubens<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>
or Murillo there was often a charming dissertation
upon the pencil of Herr Sucrewasser of
Vienna, or that great artist, Blunderbussiana of
Venice. I used to listen unobserved until I was
ready to kill myself with laughter, at the authorities
quoted to the squires and farmers of Wiltshire,
who took all for gospel. It was the most ridiculous
thing in effect you can conceive. Between sixty
and seventy years ago people did not know as
much of the fine arts as they do now. Not
but that they have still much to learn.” The
biographies of Aldrovandus Magnus of Bruges,
of Andrew Guelph and Og of Basan, disciples of
the former, of Sucrewasser of Vienna, Blunderbussiana
of Dalmatia, and Watersouchy of
Amsterdam, make up, as the author said in
his last years, “a laughable book”; but, indeed,
it is more than that, for it contains much brilliant
satire on the Dutch and Flemish schools, showing
that the writer, although so young, had profited
by his early training in art. “[It is] a performance,”
Lockhart wrote in 1834, “in which the
buoyancy of juvenile spirits sees of the results of
already extensive observation, and the judgments
of a refined (though far too fastidious and exclusive)
taste.”</p>

<p>In June 1780 Beckford, with Lettice again as
his companion, went abroad for the second time,<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
and visited Holland, Germany, Austria and Italy,
staying for a while at Naples with his relative, Sir
William Hamilton, whose first wife was then
living. During this tour the young traveller made
notes that soon after he expanded and printed
under the title of “Dreams, Waking Thoughts,
and Incidents.” This book is composed of impressionist
sketches made as his mind dictated, and
nowhere did he allow himself to be shackled by
the rules laid down by the compilers of works of
travel. If anyone wants full particulars of a town,
either topographical or historical, it is not to
“Dreams, Waking Thoughts, and Incidents” he
must turn; but if he desires exquisite word-pictures
inspired by a brilliant imagination and
conveyed with great literary skill, these he can
find to his heart’s content. The story goes that
the book was suppressed by the author acting
on the advice of his friends, who represented that
the brilliant imagination therein displayed would
create a prejudice against him when he should
enter the practical field of public life, but it can
scarcely be contended that this was the reason
why at the eleventh hour it was withdrawn. As
a matter of fact there were rumours, started no one
knows how, of grave misconduct on Beckford’s
part, and probably it was thought that the tendency
to romance laid bare in the work might give<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
some colour to them. These rumours endured
through Beckford’s life, and the scandal was
certainly widely circulated, but there seems to
have been absolutely no grounds whatever for the
charges. That Beckford should deny the charges
was a matter of course, and, indeed, he protested
passionately against them; but even John Mitford,
an envenomed critic of his brother-author, had to
admit that Samuel Richard White, Beckford’s
solicitor, who knew more about the matter than
anyone else, after his client’s death as during
his life, declared his firm belief in Beckford’s
innocence.</p>

<p>In due course there were the coming-of-age
festivities at Fonthill, and then another Continental
tour, when Beckford was accompanied
by so large a suite that at Augsburg he was
mistaken for the Emperor of Austria, who at the
time was known to be travelling incognito to Italy.
Early in 1783, when he was two and twenty years
of age, he came to England, saw, wooed, and
married Lady Margaret Gordon, the sole surviving
daughter of the Fourth Earl of Aboyne.</p>

<p>The years 1783 to 1786 make little call upon
Beckford’s biographer. The honeymoon had been
spent in travelling, and when it was over the
bride and bridegroom, still ardent lovers, stayed
for a while at Cologny, near Geneva. Towards<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
the end of the year, having made up their minds
to sojourn for an indefinite period under southern
skies, they decided to rent a more commodious
residence, and took up their quarters at the
Château de la Tour, near Vevey. There, in
June 1784, was born a daughter, Susan Euphemia,
and, on 14th May 1786, another, Margaret Maria
Elizabeth. A fortnight later the young mother
died. The marriage had been an ideal union, and
Beckford’s grief was terrible. His friends, fearful
of his losing his reason or taking his life, moved
him from place to place, hoping that change
of scene might distract his thoughts, even
momentarily, from the loss. To some extent this
plan was successful, for after some weeks Beckford
became again a reasonable being. He allowed
arrangements to be made for his children to live
with his mother, then residing at West End,
between the villages of Hampstead and Kilburn;
but himself continued to move restlessly from town
to town, seeking, not change of place so much as
change of thought. Though time mercifully
mitigated the transports of his grief, it never
ousted from his mind the memory of his gracious,
beautiful wife. Rarely he spoke of her, but when
he did mention her it was in a way which made it
clear that she was always in his mind; though
his wealth and genius made him the target of<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
fortune-hunters, he never even thought to marry
again; and his tender memories of her, enduring
through the passage of years, acting upon an
emotional nature, may have had more to do
with his subsequent retirement than is generally
supposed.</p>

<p>Before Beckford left England for his second
Continental tour he had begun the composition
of a “Suite des Contes arabes.” Of this the
principal story was “Vathek,” which he completed
while he was abroad. He sent the manuscript
in 1783 to his friend, the Rev. Samuel
Henley, who was delighted with it, and volunteered
to translate it into English. The offer was
accepted, but Henley proceeded leisurely with
the work, which, with the notes added by him,
was not finished until early in 1786. Beckford,
however, was desirous to insert in “Vathek” the
stories of the Princes whom his hero met in the
Hall of Eblis, and he told Henley that on no
account must the publication of the translation
precede that of the original. Henley, however,
ignored the author’s injunction, and issued the
translation later in the year, and made matters
worse by stating that the tale was of Eastern
origin: Beckford hereupon made the only rejoinder
in his power, and issued the French
original at Lausanne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span></p>

<p>After bringing his children to England Beckford
returned to the Continent, where he remained
until 1794, visiting Spain and Portugal, where he
wrote another book of travels, and staying for
some time in Paris, where he witnessed the fall
of the Bastille and the execution of Louis XVI.
At Paris he was at one time mistaken for an
English spy, and he was in danger of arrest, from
which he was saved by the devotion of the
second-hand bookseller, Chardin, who contrived
his escape in disguise to England, for which
he was rewarded by Beckford with a pension.
Subsequently Beckford endeavoured, through
his agent at Paris, to set on foot, in 1797,
negotiations for a peace between France and
this country.</p>

<p>After 1794 Beckford seldom left England
except to pay brief visits to Paris. At Fonthill
he employed James Wyatt, the architect, to
make improvements in the house his father had
built; and subsequently he erected a new house,
the famous Fonthill Abbey, a magnificent but
unsubstantial Gothic structure. Once Beckford
was asked if the Abbey was built from his own
plan. “No, I have sins enough to answer for,
without having that laid to my charge,” he
answered. “Wyatt had an opportunity of raising
a splendid monument to his fame, but he missed<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
it.” But whatever was said against the Abbey, no
one had anything but praise for the gardens and
park, which were, indeed, beautiful. Beckford
lived at Fonthill until 1822, when, owing to the
depreciation of his property in the West Indies,
he sold the place and moved to Bath, where he
remained until his death twenty-two years later.</p>

<p>Though Beckford had many visitors at Fonthill,
he was singularly independent of company,
having more resources in himself than usually falls
to the lot of a man. “I love building, planting,
gardening, whatever will keep me employed in
the open air,” he said; and, while the Abbey
was being built and the grounds laid out, he
might have been seen at all hours of the day,
and sometimes, too, at night, watching the
progress of the operations. He charged himself
with the welfare of his workmen, of whom
there were never less than two hundred in his
employ; he visited the poor on his estates, and
made provision for those who could not help
themselves.</p>

<p>Beckford’s indoor occupations were numerous.
It has been said, and with some show of reason,
that he was the most accomplished man of his
time. He was a good musician, he could sketch,
he spoke five modern European tongues, and could
write three of them with elegance, he was well<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
acquainted with Persian, Arabic, and, of course,
the Latin and Greek classics; while his reading
was at least as extensive as that of any of his
contemporaries. Anyone who has these accomplishments
can scarcely be dull, and Beckford, in
addition, was an enthusiastic collector of books,
pictures, and other treasures, in pursuit of which
he frequently went to London to inspect the
dealers’ stocks of scarce volumes and fine paintings.
Though he yielded to none in his love of
tall copies, splendid bindings and rare editions,
he was student as well as collector: and it was
characteristic of his tastes that while, in later
life, he sometimes disposed of a picture, he never
sold a book. Even as in his youth he secluded
himself at Lausanne to read Gibbon’s library,
which he had purchased, so afterwards he rarely
put on his shelves any volume until he had made
himself acquainted with its contents; and, large
as his library was, to the end of his days he could
without a moment’s hesitation put his hand on
any book or print he possessed. It was his habit
to annotate his books, and to write some brief
criticism on the fly-leaf. Sometimes his comments
covered three or four pages, and one of the most
valuable items offered at the sale of his library,
in 1882–1883, was this item, knocked down to
Quaritch for forty-two pounds: “Beckfordiana.<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
Transcript from the autograph notes written by
Mr Beckford on the fly-leaves of various works
in his library, 7 vols., Manuscript (folio).” His
comments were unusually shrewd, and often so
caustic as to suggest that had he been obliged to
earn his living he might well have turned an
honest penny by contributing to one or other of
the quarterlies in the days when severity was the
motto of these periodicals.</p>

<p>In Wiltshire Beckford rarely went beyond
the limits of his estate, except when driving to
London; but at Bath he might occasionally be
seen at a concert or a flower show, and not infrequently
riding on his cream-coloured Arabian,
either alone, attended by three grooms, two
behind and one in front as an outrider, or in
company with the Duke of Hamilton or a friend.
He was always dressed in a great-coat with cloth
buttons, a buff-striped waistcoat, breeches of the
same kind of cloth as the coat, and brown top
boots, the fine cotton stockings appearing over
them, in the fashion of thirty or forty years
before. He wore his hair powdered, and with his
handsome face and fine eyes looked every inch the
fine old English gentleman.</p>

<p>These appearances in public were the only
difference between the life Beckford led at
Fonthill and at Bath. In fine weather it was<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
his invariable custom to rise early, ride to the
tower he had erected at Lansdown, look at the
flowers, and walk back to his house for breakfast.
He would then read until noon, transact business
with his steward, and afterwards ride out for
exercise, again visiting the tower, if there was
any planting or building going on. After dinner,
which in those days was served in the afternoon,
unless he had a visitor, he would retire to his
library, and occupy himself with his correspondence,
his books and his prints, and the examination
of catalogues of sales sent to him by the
London dealers. This routine was seldom varied,
except when he went to London, where by this
time he had removed from No. 22 Grosvenor
Square to a house, No. 127 Park Street,
overlooking Hyde Park, which, owing to its
somewhat unwholesome insanitary condition, he
styled, and dated from, “Cesspool House.” In
1841, because of its many defects, he gave up
this residence.</p>

<p>The Bath aristocracy and the fashionable folk
who flocked to the watering-place could not
understand how books and pictures, music and
gardens, could occupy anyone to the exclusion of
participation in the gaieties of the town; and
the rumours that had been current in Wiltshire
society were revived with interest in the little<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
Somersetshire valley. The most awful crimes
were placed to his account, and with them
accusations of devil-worship and the study of
astrology. Nothing was too terrible or too absurd
with which to charge the man of mystery, and,
we are told, “surmises were current about a brood
of dwarfs that vegetated in an apartment built
over the archway connecting his two houses;
and the vulgar, rich and poor alike, gave a sort
of half-credit to cabalistical monstrosities invoked
in that apartment.”</p>

<p>Though in his later years Beckford rarely indulged
in the pleasures of authorship, he did not
underrate his literary gifts, and he saw with
pleasure that “Vathek” was taking the place in
English literature to which it was entitled. New
editions were called for, and in 1834 it took its
place among Bentley’s Standard Novels. The
venture must have been profitable, for Bentley
became Beckford’s publisher-in-chief. He at once
took over the “Biographical Memoirs of Extraordinary
Painters,” and in 1834 issued “Italy,
with Sketches of Spain and Portugal”&mdash;a work
that appeared in the same year also in Baudry’s
European Library, published in Paris. In 1835
Bentley brought out “Alcobaça and Batalha,”
and five years later republished this and the earlier
book of travels in one volume&mdash;the last edition<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
of any of Beckford’s books issued in the author’s
lifetime. Beckford’s interest in the various publications
was very considerable, and his annoyance
with adverse critics is only to be compared with
the anger he displayed when rival collectors at
auction sales snatched treasures from his grasp.
The adverse critics of “Italy, with Sketches of
Spain and Portugal,” however, were few and far
between. It was, indeed, received with a chorus
of praise, and no one cried “Bravo!” louder
than Lockhart, who reviewed the work in <i>The
Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

<p>Though Beckford lived to the patriarchal age
of eighty-four, almost to the last hour of his life
he enjoyed good health. It has already been said
that when nearly eighty he declared he had never
known a moment’s <i>ennui</i>: few men have been able
to say so much; yet there is no doubt this was
true, for he had stumbled upon the secret that
only the idle man is bored. Beckford was never
idle; he had made so many interests for himself
that every moment of his day was occupied. A
man of his age who, in his last weeks, retains all
his enthusiasms for his books, his prints and his
gardens, may well claim that he has made a
success of life. His intellectual power never waned,
his sight was preserved to him unimpaired, and
at seventy-eight he could read from manuscript<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>
for an hour and a half without resting. When
his last illness overtook him, he was busily engaged
in marking a catalogue of M. Nodier’s
library, the sale of which at Paris his agent was
to attend to make purchases: he was as enthusiastic
about his collections at the age of eighty-four
as he had been when he took up his residence
at Fonthill fifty years before.</p>

<p>Physically, too, considering his great age, he
was wonderfully active, and until within a few
days of his death he took regular exercise on foot
and on horseback. When he was seventy-seven
he astonished a friend by mentioning that he
had on the previous day at dusk ridden from
Cheapside to his house in Park Street; and a
year later he stated, “I never feel fatigue. I can
walk twenty to thirty miles a day; and I only
use my carriage (in London) on account of its
being convenient to put a picture or book into
it, which I happen to purchase in my rambles.”
At seventy-five his activity was so great that he
could mount rapidly to the top of the tower at
Lansdown without halting&mdash;“no small exertion,”
comments Cyrus Redding feelingly, “for many
who were fifteen or twenty years younger”: and
even eight years later, during his visits to London,
he would ride to Hampstead Heath, or through
Hyde Park, and along the Edgware Road to<span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>
West End, and pull up his horse opposite the
spot where once had been the entrance to his
mother’s house.</p>

<p>Most men who live to an advanced age have
some theory to account for it. Beckford had none,
beyond believing that his days had probably been
prolonged by the fact that his life had been
temperate, and that, as he grew older, he took
reasonable care of himself. “I enjoy too good
health, feel too happy, and am too much pleased
with life to have any inclination to throw it away
for want of attention,” he said. “When I am
summoned I must go, though I should not much
mind living another hundred years, and, as far
as my health goes at present, I see no reason why
I should not.” Thus, when going out he would
put on an overcoat, even if there were only the
slightest wind stirring; and, however interested
or amused he might be, he would always retire
early; but while he took such precautions as
these, he was in no sense a valetudinarian. His
love of fresh air, and his activity, together with
the regular life he led, undoubtedly had much
to do with his attaining his great age.</p>

<p>Until the last week of April 1844, Beckford
occupied himself in his usual way, walking and
riding, and working in his library. Then influenza
laid hold of him, and though he struggled man<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>fully
against it, at last there was no doubt that
the end was near. He sent a last laconic note to
his surviving daughter, the Duchess of Hamilton,
“Come quick! quick!” and a day or two after
her arrival, on 2nd May, he expired, with perfect
resignation, and, we are told, so peacefully that
those by his side could not tell the moment when
he passed away.</p>

<p>His mortal remains were, on 11th May, interred
in the Bath Abbey Cemetery; but soon after they
were removed, and reburied, more appropriately,
at Lansdown, under the shadow of his tower. On
one side of his tomb is a quotation from “Vathek,”
“Enjoying humbly the most precious gift of
heaven to man&mdash;Hope”; and on another these
lines from his poem, “A Prayer”:</p>

<h2>Charles James Fox</h2>


<p class="dropcap">Charles James Fox, one of the
most brilliant personalities, if not, indeed,
the most brilliant personality,
that flourished in the last decades of the eighteenth
century, was the third son of Henry Fox, afterwards
Baron Holland of Foxley, and Lady
Georgiana Lennox, daughter of Charles, second
Duke of Richmond, a grandson of Charles II.
The future statesman was born on 24th January
1749, and as he grew up it was thought that
a resemblance to his royal ancestor could be
traced in his dark, harsh and saturnine features,
that “derived a sort of majesty from the addition
of two black and shaggy eyebrows, which sometimes
concealed, but more frequently developed,
the workings of his mind.” He was a bright,
lively and original child, but subject to violent
excesses of temper. “Charles is dreadfully passionate,”
said his mother. “What shall we do with
him?” “Oh, never mind. He is a very sensible
little fellow, and he will learn to cure himself,”
replied his father, who perceived and was proud
of the lad’s unusual ability. “Let nothing be
done to break his spirit; the world will effect
that business soon enough.”</p>

<p>At a private school at Wandsworth, and subsequently
at Eton, where Dr Philip Francis was
his private tutor, the lad showed himself both<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
intelligent and diligent. His education was interrupted
in 1763, when his father took him to
Paris and Spa, and at that early age initiated him
into the mysteries of gaming, the passion for
which was subsequently to exercise a most adverse
influence on him. On his return to Eton
his newly acquired knowledge of the world
demoralised his companions, and he gave himself
airs and thought himself a man until the
headmaster birched him, and so brought him
down to earth. In 1764 he went to Hertford
College, Oxford, preceded by a reputation for
Latin verse, a considerable knowledge of French,
and a power of oratory unusual in one so young,
but which he attributed to the fact that at home
he had always been encouraged to think freely,
and as freely to express his opinions. At the
University he read deeply in classics and history,
and the taste then developed endured through
life, for, while he indulged in many frivolities,
he would in the midst of them steal a few hours
to devote to the books of which he never wearied.
Towards the end of his days he put his learning
into harness, and wrote a history of the reign of
James II. and an account of the Revolution of
1688 that do not deserve to be relegated to
obscurity.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the faults of<span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
Fox, but some of them, at least, should not be
held greatly to his discredit, since they were the
faults of the age. Wine, women and cards were
the occupations of his companions, and not of
the unintelligent only. Everybody drank and
drank deeply, drank in pursuit of pleasure, drank
to drown sorrow.</p>

<p>“I dined at Holland House” (wrote the Right
Honourable Charles Rigby upon one occasion to
George Selwyn), “where, though I drank claret
with the master of it from dinner till two in the
morning, I could not wash away the sorrow he is
in at the shocking condition his eldest boy is in.”</p>

<p>Fox, Sheridan, Pitt and, notably, Professor
Porson were three-bottle men, and it was not
unusual for politicians to go to Westminster Hall
in a state of insobriety.</p>

<p>“Fox drinks what I should call a great deal,
though he is not reckoned to do so by his companions;
Sheridan, excessively, and Grey more
than any of them; while Pitt, I am told, drinks
as much as anybody, generally more than any of
his company, and is a pleasant, convivial man at
table,”</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Elliot has recorded; and Lord
Bulkeley wrote to the Marquis of Buckingham<span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span>
à propos of Pitt bringing in the Declaratory Bill
of the powers of the Board of Control:</p>

<p>“It was an awkward day for him (owing to the
defection of some friends), and he felt it the
more because he himself was low-spirited, and
overcome by the heat of the House, in consequence
of having got drunk the night before at
your house in Pall Mall, with Mr Dundas and
the <i>Duchess of Gordon</i>! They must have had a
hard bout of it, for even Dundas, who is well
used to the bottle, was affected by it, and spoke
remarkably ill, dull and tedious.”</p>

<p>One reads with amazement of a Chancellor of
the Exchequer, a Lord Chancellor and a
Treasurer of the Navy&mdash;Pitt, Thurlow and
Dundas&mdash;excited by wine galloping through a
turnpike gate without paying the toll, and the
man, mistaking them for highwaymen, discharging
his blunderbuss. This exploit was duly
noted in “The Rolliad.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Ah! think what danger on debauch attends!</div>
<div class="verse">Let Pitt o’er wine preach temperance to his friends,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span></p>

<p>A great drinker, too, was Jack Talbot of the
Coldstream Guards, and it was of him, when the
doctor said: “My lord, he is in a bad way, for I
was obliged to make use of the lancet this
morning,” that the witty Alvanley remarked:
“You should have <i>tapped</i> him, Doctor, for I am
sure he has more claret than blood in his veins.”
Another was the eccentric Twistleton Fiennes,
Lord Saye and Sele, a famous epicure, who
drank large quantities of absinthe and curaçoa.
Gronow recommended him a servant, who,
arriving as Fiennes was going to dinner, asked
his new master if he had any orders, only to
receive these instructions: “Place two bottles
of sherry by my bedside, and call me the day
after to-morrow!”</p>

<p>Gambling vied with drinking as an amusement
of the aristocracy, and the one was as ruinous to
their purses as the other to their health. Everyone
played cards in those days, and even ladies
gambled with as much zest as their husbands and
brothers. There was much card-playing in private
houses, but more in the clubs, especially at
White’s, Brooks’s and Almack’s.</p>

<p>“As the gambling and extravagance of the young
men of fashion has arrived now at a pitch never
heard of, it is worth while to give some account<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
of it” (Walpole wrote in 1772). “They have a
club at Almack’s in Pall Mall, where they played
only for rouleaus of fifty pounds each rouleau; and
generally there was ten thousand pounds in specie
on the table. Lord Holland had paid about
twenty thousand pounds for his two sons. Nor
were the manners of the gamesters, or even their
dresses for play, undeserving notice. They began
by pulling off their embroidered clothes, and put
on frieze great-coats, or turned their coats inside
outwards for luck. They put on pieces of leather
(such as is worn by footmen when they clean
knives) to save their lace ruffles; and to guard
their eyes from the light and prevent tumbling
their hair, wore high-crowned straw hats with
broad brims, and adorned with flowers and
ribbons; masks to conceal their emotions when
they played at quinze. Each gamester had a small,
neat stand by him, with a large rim, to hold their
tea, or a wooden bowl with an edge of ormolu
to hold their rouleaus. They borrowed great
sums of the Jews at exorbitant premiums. Charles
Fox called his outward room, where those Jews
waited till he rose, the Jerusalem Chamber. His
brother Stephen was enormously fat; George
Selwyn said he was in the right to deal with
Shylocks, as he could give them ‘pounds of
flesh.’&#8239;”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span></p>

<p>It is not exaggeration to say that during the
long sittings at macao, hazard, and faro many
tens of thousands exchanged hands.</p>

<p>Fox was a magnificent player of piquet and
whist, but in the evenings, when he had dined
well and wined well, he would play only games
of chance, at which he was always unlucky.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“At Almack’s of pigeons I’m told there are flocks,</div>
<div class="verse">But it’s thought the completest is one Mr Fox.</div>
<div class="verse">If he touches a card, if he rattles a box,</div>
<div class="verse">Away fly the guineas of this Mr Fox.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Once, before delivering a speech in defence of
the Church, he played for twenty-two hours, and
lost five hundred pounds an hour; and then declared
that the greatest pleasure in life, after
winning, was losing! His bad luck was notorious,
but again and again his intimates came to his
assistance, and Walpole wondered what he would
do when he had sold the estates of all his friends!
It was noticed that he did not do himself justice
in a debate on the Thirty-Nine Articles (6th
February 1772), and Walpole thought it was
not to be wondered at.</p>

<p>“He had sat up playing at hazard at Almack’s
from Tuesday evening, the 4th, till five in the
afternoon of Wednesday, 5th. An hour before, he<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
had recovered twelve thousand pounds that he
had lost, and by dinner, which was at five o’clock,
he had ended losing eleven thousand pounds.
On the Thursday he spoke in the above debate,
went to dinner at half-past eleven at night, from
there to White’s, where he drank till seven the
next morning, thence to Almack’s, where he won
six thousand pounds, and between three and four
in the afternoon he set out for Newmarket. His
brother Stephen lost ten thousand pounds two
nights after, and Charles eleven thousand pounds
more on the 13th, so that in three nights the two
brothers, the eldest not twenty-four, lost thirty-two
thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>The wonder is, not that Fox spoke ill, but that
he spoke at all.</p>

<p>They were good losers in those days, and stoicism
was a very necessary quality to be possessed
by the majority, since all played and few won.
One night, when Fox had been terribly unfortunate
at the faro-table, Topham Beauclerk
followed him to his rooms to offer consolation,
expecting to find him perhaps stretched on the
floor bewailing his losses, perhaps plunged
in moody despair. He was surprised to see him
reading Herodotus. “What would you have me
do?” Fox asked the astonished visitor. “I have<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>
lost my last shilling.” “Charles tells me he has
not now, nor has had for some time, one guinea,”
Lord Carlisle told George Selwyn, “and is happier
on that account.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“But hark! the voice of battle shouts from far,</div>
<div class="verse">The Jews and Macaronis are at war;</div>
<div class="verse">The Jews prevail, and, thund’ring from the stocks,</div>
<div class="verse">They seize, they bind, they circumcise Charles Fox.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The money-lenders were most obliging to
Fox at the time when he was heir-apparent to
the barony of Holland, but the holder of the
title had an heir, which destroyed his prospects;
whereupon Fox, unperturbed, made it the subject
of a joke against his creditors: “My brother Ste’s
son is a second Messiah, born for the destruction
of the Jews.” He lived on credit for some time,
and so notorious was this fact that when he gave
a supper-party at his rooms in St James’s Street,
close by Brooks’s Club, Tickell addressed verses
thereon to Sheridan:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Derby shall send, if not his plate, his cooks;</div>
<div class="verse">And know, I’ve bought the best champagne from Brooks,</div>
<div class="verse">From liberal Brooks, whose speculative skill</div>
<div class="verse">Is hasty credit and a distant bill;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, nursed on clubs, disdains a vulgar trade,</div>
<div class="verse">Exults to trust, and blushes to be paid.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lord Holland had already paid his son’s debts<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
on several occasions, and apparently some remonstrance
was addressed to the latter.</p>

<p>“In regard to what you say of my father’s feelings,
I am sure if you could have known how
very miserable you have made me you would
not have said it” (Fox wrote in 1773 to Lady
Holland, in a letter in which there is the true
note of sincerity). “To be loved by you and him
has always been (indeed, I am no hypocrite,
whatever I may be) the first desire of my life.
The reflection that I have behaved ill to you is
almost the only painful one I have ever experienced.
That my extreme imprudence and dissipation
has given both of you uneasiness is what I
have long known, and I am sure I may call those
who really know me to witness how much that
thought has embittered my life. I own I lately
began to flatter myself that, particularly with
you, and in a great measure with my father, I
had regained that sort of confidence which was
once the greatest pride of my life; and I am sure
I don’t exaggerate when I say that, since I formed
those flattering hopes, I have been the happiest
being in the universe. I hate to make professions,
and yet I think I may venture to say that my
conduct in the future shall be such as to satisfy
you more than my past. Indeed, indeed, my dear<span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>
mother, no son ever loved a father and mother
as I do. Pray, my dear mother, consider how very
miserable you have made me, and pity me. I do
not know what to write, so have to leave off
writing, but you may be assured that no son ever
felt more duty, respect, gratitude, or love than I
do for both of you, and that it is in your power,
by restoring me to your usual confidence and
affection, or depriving me of it, to make me the
most unhappy or contented of men.”</p>

<p>Once again Lord Holland took upon himself
the settlement of Charles’s debt, and just before
his death, in 1774, satisfied his son’s creditors&mdash;at
a cost of £140,000! Even this was not a
sufficient lesson to the young man, who incurred
fresh liabilities, to pay which he sold a sinecure
place of £2000 a year for life&mdash;the Clerkship of
the Peels in Ireland, and the superbly decorated
mansion and estate at Kingsgate in the Isle of
Thanet, both of which had been left him by his
father.</p>

<p>Fox in his twentieth year entered Parliament
as member for the pocket borough of Midhurst
in Sussex, and, at his father’s request, supported
the Duke of Grafton’s administration. He took
his seat in May 1768, and distinguished himself
in the following year by a speech opposing the<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
claim of Wilkes to take his seat as member for
Middlesex. “It was all off-hand, all argumentative,
in reply to Mr Burke and Mr Wedderburn,
and excessively well indeed,” Lord Holland said
proudly. “I hear it spoken of as an extraordinary
thing, and I am, as you see, not a little pleased
with it.” This was the age of young men, for
Fox’s lifelong antagonist, Pitt, entered the House
when he was twenty-two, accepted the Chancellorship
of the Exchequer twelve months later, and
became Prime Minister in his twenty-fifth year!
The careers of these statesmen must have delighted
another precocious genius, Benjamin
Disraeli, who reverenced youth. “The only
tolerable thing in life is action, and action is
feeble without youth,” he wrote. “What if you
do not obtain your immediate object? You always
think you will, and the detail of the adventure
is full of rapture.” The blunders of youth,
that great man thought, are preferable to the
triumph of manhood or the successes of old
age.</p>

<p>In February 1770 Fox took office under Lord
North as Lord of the Admiralty, when, owing
to his attitude in the debates on the Press laws,
he became so unpopular with a section of the
public as actually to be attacked in the streets,
and rolled in the mud. It has already been men<span class="pagenum" title="231"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>tioned
how, in February 1772, he spoke against
the clerical petition for relief from subscription
to the Thirty-Nine Articles; and later, in the
same month, he resigned his office so as to be
free to oppose the Royal Marriage Bill, which
was introduced by the King’s command after the
announcement of the Duke of Cumberland’s
marriage with Mrs Horton. The King was determined,
so far as it lay in his power, to prevent
the occurrence in his family of another <i>mésalliance</i>,
and the principal clauses of the Royal Marriage
Act forbade the marriage of a member of the
royal family under the age of twenty-five without
the consent of the monarch, and above that age,
if the King refused consent, without the permission
of both Houses of Parliament. The Bill was
fiercely contested in both Houses of Parliament;
Fox, Burke, and Wedderburn were its most
strenuous opponents in the Commons; Lord
Folkestone, in person, and Lord Chatham, by
letter, in the Lords. It was denounced by its
opponents as “un-English, arbitrary, and contrary
to the law of God”; and the objection raised
was that it would set the royal family as a caste
apart. So unpopular was it that, in spite of the
King’s influence being exerted in its favour, an
amendment limiting it to the reign of George III.
and three years longer was negatived only by a<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
majority of eighteen. The Bill became law in
March 1772.</p>

<p>Fox began to be recognised as a power in the
House, and Lord North soon made overtures to
his erstwhile colleague to rejoin the ministry as
a Lord of the Treasury. This Fox did within a
year of his resignation, but his independence soon
brought about another rupture; and when, on a
question of procedure, he caused the defeat of the
ministry by pressing a motion to a division, the
King wrote to Lord North: “Indeed, that young
man has so thoroughly cast off every principle of
common honour and honesty that he must become
as contemptible as he is odious, and I hope you
will let him know you are not insensible of his
conduct towards you.” The Prime Minister took
the hint, and dismissed Fox in a delightfully
laconic note: “Sir, His Majesty has thought
proper to order a new Commission of the
Treasury, in which I do not see your name.”</p>

<p>In opposition Fox was a vigorous opponent of
Lord North’s policy in connection with the
American colonies. In April 1774 he voted for
the repeal of the tea duty, declaring that the tax
was the mere assertion of a right that would force
the colonists into open rebellion; and he attacked
the subsequent proceedings of the English government
on account of their manifest injustice.<span class="pagenum" title="233"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>
Against the war that ensued he protested with
might and main, and to the utmost of his power
tried to force the ministry into a pacific path.</p>

<p>“The war of the Americans is a war of passion”
(he declared on 26th November 1778); “it is of
such a nature as to be supported by the most
powerful virtues, love of liberty and of country,
and at the same time by those passions in the
human heart which give courage, strength and
perseverance to man; the spirit of revenge for
the injury you have done them, of retaliation for
the hardships inflicted on them, and of opposition
to the unjust powers you would have exercised
over them; everything combines to animate
them to this war, and such a war is without
end; for whatever obstinacy enthusiasm ever
inspired man with, you will now have to contend
with in America; no matter what gives
birth to that enthusiasm, whether the name of
religion or of liberty, the effects are the same;
it inspires a spirit that is unconquerable and
solicitous to undergo difficulties and dangers;
and as long as there is a man in America, so long
will you have him against you in the field.”</p>

<p>And in the following year he compared
George III. with Henry VI.&mdash;“both owed the<span class="pagenum" title="234"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span>
Crown to revolutions, both were pious princes, and
both lost the acquisitions of their predecessors”&mdash;and
so earned the enmity of the King, who could
not differentiate between doctrine and action; and
because Fox supported the rights of the Americans
looked upon him henceforth as a rebel. Later,
when of all the colonies only Boston remained
in the hands of the English, and Wedderburn
with foolhardy audacity ventured in the House
of Commons to compare North as a War Minister
with Chatham, Fox created a sensation by declaring
that “not Lord Chatham, nor Alexander
the Great, nor Cæsar ever conquered so much
territory in the course of all their wars as Lord
North had lost in one campaign!” In January
1781 he made a further effort, in which he was
supported by Pitt, to compel Lord North to
abandon the war and make peace with the
colonies.</p>

<p>“The only objection made to my motion” (he
declared) “is that it must lead to American independence.
But I venture to assert that <i>within six
months of the present day</i>, Ministers themselves will
come forward to Parliament with some proposition
of a similar nature. I know that such is their
intention; I announce it to the House.”</p>

<p>Of course his resolution was defeated, and the<span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
colonies were for ever lost to the Crown. “I that
am born a gentleman,” said George III. to Lord
Thurlow and the Duke of Leeds, “shall never
lay my head on my last pillow in peace and quiet
as long as I remember the loss of my American
colonies.” Not the less, the King never forgave
Fox for that attitude which might have averted
the disaster.</p>

<p>Fox, who had declined office in 1780, was two
years later appointed Foreign Secretary when
Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister, and
in this position he won golden opinions.</p>

<p>“Mr Fox already shines as greatly in place as
he did in opposition, though infinitely more
difficult a task” (Walpole wrote to Mr Horace
Mann). “He is now as indefatigable as he was
idle. He has perfect temper, and not only good
humour and good nature, but, which is the first
quality of a Prime Minister in a free country,
has more common sense than any man, with
amazing parts that are neither ostentatious nor
affected.”</p>

<p>Lord Rockingham died a few months later,
when Lord Shelburne was appointed in his place,
and soon after Fox, with some of his colleagues,
withdrew from the Ministry. The cause of his<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
secession was said to be that Fox wished to
grant independence to the American colonies as
a boon, and Lord Shelburne would regard it only
as a bargain; but the underlying reasons were
Fox’s hatred of the man and jealousy aroused by
the exclusion from office of the Duke of Portland.
It was to Lord Shelburne, who was most unpopular
and suspected of insincerity, that Goldsmith
made his singularly <i>mal à propos</i> remark:
“Do you know, I could never conceive the
reason why they call you Malagrida, for Malagrida
was a very good sort of man!”</p>

<p>Fox allied himself with Lord North, and as
they had a large majority in the House of
Commons, Lord Shelburne resigned in February
1784. The King was furious, but being
powerless, was compelled to appoint as First
Minister of the Crown the Duke of Portland,
under whom Pitt and Lord North held office as
Secretaries of State.</p>

<p>In the previous year the Prince of Wales had
come of age, and had at once attached himself
to the Opposition, who naturally welcomed so
powerful an ally.</p>

<p>“The Prince of Wales has thrown himself into
the arms of Charles, and this in the most indecent
and undisguised manner” (Walpole wrote to Sir<span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
Horace Mann). “Fox lodged in St James’s Street,
and as soon as he rose, which was very late, held
a <i>levée</i> of his followers, and of the members of
the Gambling Club at Brooks’s, all his disciples.
His bristly, black person, and shagged breast
quite open, and rarely purified by any ablutions,
was wrapped in a foul linen night-gown, and his
bushy hair dishevelled. In these cynic weeds, and
with epicurean good humour, did he dictate his
politics, and in this school did the heir to the
Crown attend his lessons and imbibe them.”</p>

<p>Fox told his new adherent that a Prince of
Wales should have no party, but, his advice
being disregarded, when the opinion was expressed
that the Prince should not attend the
debates in the House of Commons, he intervened
in defence of his friend.</p>

<p>“Is the mind, which may at any hour, by the
common changes of mortality, be summoned to
the highest duties allotted to man, to be left to
learn them by accident?” (he asked). “For my
part I rejoice to see this distinguished person disdaining
to use the privileges of his rank and keep
aloof from the debates of this House. I rejoice to
see him manfully coming among us, to imbibe a
knowledge of the Constitution within the walls<span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>
of the Commons of England. I, for my part, see
nothing in the circumstance which has called
down so much voluntary eloquence.”</p>

<p>There were many, however, who disapproved
of this alliance, and many attacks were made
upon Fox, who was the subject of many lampoons.</p>

<p>The principal act of the Administration was
the introduction of Fox’s India Bill, by which
powers were sought to take away the control of
the great dominion that Warren Hastings had
built up from the Honourable East India Company
and transfer it to a board of seven Commissioners,
who should hold office for five years
and be removable only on an Address to the Crown
from either House of Parliament. This was
bitterly opposed by the merchant class, who saw
in it a precedent for the revocation of other
charters; but the clause that aroused the greatest
bitterness was that in which it was laid down
that the appointment of the first seven Commissioners
should be vested in Parliament, and<span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
afterwards in the Crown. This was, of course,
equivalent to vesting the appointments and the
enormous patronage attaching thereto in the
Ministry, and “it was an attempt,” said Lord
Thurlow, “to take the diadem from the King’s
head and to put it on that of Mr Fox.” The Bill
was fought with every weapon, but it passed the
Commons, only, however, to be defeated by the
Lords, upon whom the King had brought his
personal influence to bear. Thereupon, in December
1783, the King contemptuously dismissed
the Ministry.</p>

<p>In the following May there was a General
Election, the chief interest of which centred
round the City of Westminster, for which Fox
and Sir Cecil Wray had sat in the dissolved
Parliament. The King, who had plotted the
downfall of the Ministry, had determined to do
his utmost to prevent Fox from sitting in the
new Parliament, but the latter, who had, however,
already been elected for Kirkwall, audaciously
carried the war into the enemy’s camp by having
himself nominated for his old constituency.</p>

<p>“It may fairly be questioned” (Mr Sidney said)
“whether any of the electoral contests of the
eighteenth century equalled that of Westminster
in point of the prevalence of corrupt practices,<span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>
drunkenness, tumult and disorder. The polling
lasted forty days, and, during the long period
over which it extended, the entire western
quarter of the Metropolis and Covent Garden,
the immediate vicinity of the hustings, presented
a scene of uproar and disorder which it is difficult
to describe. The latter locality might have been
styled ‘Bear Garden’ for the time being, so
flagrant were the outrages against decency, and
so riotous was the violence of which it was the
scene.”</p>

<p>At first the two Ministerial candidates,
Admiral Hood and Sir Cecil Wray, forged
ahead, and left Fox so far behind that the prospect
of his return appeared hopeless. Then the
influence of the many ladies of rank and fashion
who canvassed for the latter made itself felt.
The Duchess of Portland, Countess Carlisle,
Countess of Derby, Lady Beauchamp, and Lady
Duncannon were among Fox’s assistants, but the
greatest service was rendered by the beautiful
Duchess of Devonshire, whose charms have been
chronicled by every contemporary memorist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span></p>

<p>A reaction in favour of Fox set in, and when,
at three o’clock on 17th May, the poll closed, the
High Bailiff of Westminster declared the results:</p>


<div class="center pbia">

</table></div>


<p>Great were the rejoicings when it became
known that “the man of the people” had
snatched the victory from the Court candidate.
The Prince of Wales, who had thrown his
influence into the scale, went the same evening
to a supper-party given by Mrs Crewe, where all
present were arrayed in buff and blue, the victor’s
colours. The Prince proposed the health of the
hostess with felicitous brevity, “True Blue and
Mrs Crewe,” to which the lady wittily replied,
“True Blue, and all of you”; and the hero of
the hour returned thanks to all and sundry.</p>

<p>It was to Mr Fox and Mrs Armitstead (with
whom Fox was then living and whom he married
in 1795), at the latter’s house at St Anne’s,
Chertsey, that the Prince repaired to pour out
his woes when, to evade his compromising attentions,
Mrs Fitzherbert went abroad.</p>

<p>“Mrs Armitstead has repeatedly assured me”
(Lord Holland relates in his “Memoirs of the<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>
Whig Party”) “that he came thither more than
once to converse with her and Mr Fox on the
subject, that he cried by the hour, that he
testified to the sincerity and violence of his
passion and his despair by the most extravagant
expressions and actions, rolling on the floor,
striking his forehead, tearing his hair, falling
into hysterics, and swearing he would abandon
the country, forego the Crown, sell his jewels
and plate, and scrape together a competence to
fly with the object of his affections to America.”</p>

<p>When Mrs Fitzherbert returned to England, Fox
implored the Prince not to marry her, and received
from him a reply, “Make yourself easy,
my dear friend! Believe me, the world will soon
be convinced that not only is there not, but never
was, any grounds for these reports, which have
been so malevolently circulated.” On the strength
of this letter, when the question was raised in
the House of Commons in a debate on the
Prince’s debts, Fox denied the marriage, only
to be told by a relative of the lady at Brooks’s
Club, within an hour of his speech, that the
marriage had taken place! It is said that the
statesman was furious at the deception that
had been practised upon him; but doubtless
his sense of humour came to his rescue:<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
one can imagine him shrugging his shoulders
with his almost imperturbable good humour, as
he reflected that while his position as a dupe
was distressing, what must be the feeling of
him who had duped him. It was, indeed, a
case of the biter bit! Perhaps, too, he was
amused at having saved the Prince <i>malgré lui</i>;
and certainly it is to his credit that “when urged
by his friends to undeceive Parliament, and thus
vindicate himself in the opinion of the country,
he refused to do so at the expense of the heir to
the monarchy.” But there was on his part a coldness
towards the Prince for some time, and he
never again trusted that royal personage.</p>

<p>It is impossible within the limits of this paper
to discuss Fox’s subsequent political career, or to
make more than an allusion to the attacks on
Warren Hastings during the famous impeachment,
to his advocacy of the Prince as the rightful
Regent during the King’s illness, and his
opposition to many of Pitt’s measures. His remark
on hearing of the taking of the Bastille
has become historic: “How much is this the
greatest event that ever happened in the world,
and how much the best”; but he never approved
of the excesses that followed, and he was opposed
to all absolute forms of government, and not more
averse to an absolute monarchy or an absolute<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
aristocracy than to an absolute democracy. From
1792 for five years he seldom attended Parliament,
but devoted himself chiefly to the composition
of his “History of the Revolution of 1688.”
In 1798 his name was erased from the list of
Privy Councillors because at a dinner he proposed
the toast of “Our Sovereign, the people.”
Later he went abroad, had an interview with
Napoleon, and on his return, in 1803, in a
magnificent speech advocated a peace with
France. On Lord Addington’s resignation in
the following year it was proposed that Fox
should be a member of the new Cabinet, but the
King intervened to make Pitt promise, firstly,
never to support Catholic Emancipation, and,
secondly, to exclude Fox from office. However,
two years later, Fox accepted the portfolio of
the Foreign Office under Grenville, in the
“Ministry of all the Talents.” He made his
last appearance in the House of Commons on
10th June 1806, to move a resolution preparatory
to introducing a Bill for the suppression of the
slave trade.</p>

<p>“So fully am I impressed with the vast importance
and necessity of attaining what will be the
object of my motion this night” (he concluded
his farewell speech) “that if, during the almost<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
forty years that I have had the honour of a seat
in Parliament, I had been so fortunate as to accomplish
that, and that only, I should think I
had done enough, and could retire from public
life with comfort and the conscious satisfaction
that I had done my duty.”</p>

<p>A few days after, he was taken ill at the house
of the Duke of Devonshire at Chiswick, and it
was soon apparent that his last hours were near.
He was no believer in religion, but, to please his
wife, he consented to have prayers read, though he
“paid little attention to the ceremony, remaining
quiescent merely, not liking to refuse any wish
of hers, nor to pretend any sentiments he did
not entertain.” “I die happy,” he said to his
wife, “but I pity you.” He died on 13th September,
and was interred in Westminster Abbey,
immediately adjoining the monument of Lord
Chatham, and close by the grave of William
Pitt, his great rival, who had predeceased him
by a few months.</p>

<p>As a constructive statesman, Charles James Fox
had but little opportunity to shine.</p>

<p>“Charles is unquestionably a man of first rate
talents, but so deficient in judgment as never to
have succeeded in any object during his whole<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
life” (said his “candid friend,” Boothby). “He loved
only three things, women, play, and politics. Yet
at no period did he ever form a creditable connection
with a woman. He lost his whole fortune
at the gaming table; and, with the exception of
about eleven months of his life, he has remained
always in opposition.”</p>

<p>This is a severe pronouncement upon a great
man, who was a great orator and a splendid
debater.</p>

<p>“Fox delivered his speeches without previous
preparation, and their power lay not in rhetorical
adornments, but in the vigour of the speaker’s
thoughts, the extent of his knowledge, the quickness
with which he grasped the significance of
each point in debate, the clearness of his conceptions,
and the remarkable plainness with which
he laid them before his audience” (says Professor
Harrison). “Even in the longest speeches he never
strayed from the matter in hand; he never rose
above the level of his hearers’ understanding, was
never obscure, and never bored the House. Every
position that he took up he defended by a large
number of shrewd arguments, plainly stated and
well ordered.”</p>

<p>His voice was poor, his actions ungainly, and
he did not become fluent until he warmed with<span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
his subject; but in attack generally, and especially
in connection with the American War, Grattan
thought him the best speaker he had ever heard.
Burke said he was “the most brilliant and accomplished
debater that the world ever saw”; Rogers
declared he “never heard anything equal to Fox’s
<i>speeches in reply</i>”; while, when someone abused
one of Fox’s speeches to Pitt, the latter remarked,
“Don’t disparage it; nobody could have made
it but himself.”</p>

<p>Fox, however, did not lay undue stress on
eloquence, and in a well-known speech declared
that one sometimes paid too dearly for oratory.</p>

<p>“I remember” (he said) “a time when the whole
of the Privy Council came away, throwing up
their caps, and exulting in an extraordinary
manner at a speech made by the present Lord
Rosslyn (Alexander Wedderburn), and an examination
of Dr Franklin (before the Privy
Council on the letters of Hutchinson and Oliver,
the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of Massachusetts),
in which that respectable man was most
uncommonly badgered. But we paid very dear for
that splendid specimen of eloquence, and all its
attendant tropes, figures, metaphors, and hyperbole;
for then came the Bill, and in the end we
lost all our American colonies, a hundred millions<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>
of money, and a hundred thousand of our brave
fellow subjects.”</p>

<p>Fox made mistakes occasionally, as when he
asserted the <i>right</i> of the Prince of Wales to the
Regency; but he was distinguished in the House
of Commons for his “hopeful sympathy with all
good and great causes.” In a day when politicians
were not especially enlightened, he was a supporter
of Parliamentary reform, a champion of Catholic
Emancipation, and an opponent of the slave trade;
and, indeed, it was by his advocacy of these
measures that he earned the enmity of the King,
and thus was prevented from carrying out these
beneficial schemes.</p>

<p>It has already been admitted that he was a
spendthrift, and had a passion for gaming which,
when taxed with it by Lord Hillsborough in the
House of Commons, he designated as “a vice
countenanced by the fashion of the times, a vice
to which some of the greatest characters had given
way in the early part of their lives, and a vice
which carried with it its own punishment.” His
weaknesses, however, were more than balanced
by his many splendid qualities. He was a
noble antagonist, and when Pitt made his first
speech, and someone remarked he would be one
of the first in Parliament, “He is so already,”<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
said Fox. Which recalls the story of the Prince
of Wales’ remark, on hearing of the death of the
Duchess of Devonshire: “Then we have lost
the best-bred woman in England.” “Then,” said
the more generous Fox, “we have lost the kindest
heart in England.”</p>

<p>Fox was a great-hearted man, with a beautiful
disposition, high spirits, unbounded good-humour,
delightful conversation, a great affection for his
friends, an undeniable loyalty to those who trusted
him; and these qualities, combined with his
great natural abilities and an indisputable charm,
made him a great, commanding and fascinating
figure. Gibbon, a political opponent, said he
possessed “the powers of a superior man, as they
are blended in his attractive character, with the
softness and simplicity of a child,” adding that
“perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly
exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity or
falsehood”; but the greatest tribute came from
Burke, who described him simply and, perhaps,
sufficiently as “a man made to be loved.”</p>

<h2>Philip, Duke of Wharton</h2>


<p class="dropcap">In the history of every country a few figures
stand out conspicuous, not necessarily for
ability or virtue, or even vice, but through
the power of a dominating personality or the
strangeness of their career. In the Georgian
annals of England in the forefront of these
heroes of romance stands, head and shoulders
above the rest, Charles James Fox, whose genius
and fascinations, indeed, whose very faults, seize
the imagination, and hold it captive, a willing
prisoner; but there are others, minor lights to
this great star, yet still shining so brightly as to
dazzle the sober senses of twentieth-century social
historians, a body not given unduly to hero-worship.
Such a one was Brummell, another was
“Beau” Nash, both arbiters of fashion, veritable
kings in the eyes of their contemporaries; a third
was Elizabeth Chudleigh, Countess of Bristol,
Duchess of Kingston, greater still as Beatrix,
queen of hearts, in “Esmond”; and to a place
in this gallery of adventurous spirits none can
deny the right of Philip, Duke of Wharton,
Richardson’s Lovelace, gallant, wit, statesman,
satirist, poet and pamphleteer, like Dryden’s
Zimri, “everything by starts and nothing long,”
a man who threw away great gifts, honour, loyalty
and love, as freely, and with as little regard for
consequences, as Fox squandered his gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span></p>

<p>Philip, born on Christmas Eve, 1698, was the
only son of Thomas, fourth Baron Wharton, by
his second wife, Lucy, daughter of Lord Lisburne,
who in that year was a toast at the Kit-Cat
Club:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“When Jove to Ida did the gods invite,</div>
<div class="verse">And in immortal toastings pass’d the night,</div>
<div class="verse">With more than bowls of nectar were they blest,</div>
<div class="verse">For Venus was the Wharton of the feast!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lord Wharton&mdash;for his services to William III.
created in 1706 earl, when his heir became known
as Viscount Winchendon&mdash;was not only a pleasure-loving
man, but also a strenuous politician. He,
imbued with the idea that his boy, in his turn,
might add further laurels to the family name,
with this object in view kept a more than paternal
eye upon the direction of the youngster’s studies.
To his parents’ great joy, Philip gave signs of
precocious cleverness, and it was decided to have
him educated by private tutors, instructed, after
their pupil was well grounded in the classics,
to teach him in a very thorough manner the
history of Europe, with, of course, special reference
to that of his own country; and to train
him as an orator by making him read and recite
passages from Shakespeare and from the great
speeches of the most eloquent statesmen of that
and bygone ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span></p>

<p>Philip evinced much readiness, and diligently
applied himself to his studies; but his father’s
love of pleasure was in his blood, and while for
some time he submitted to the company of his
teachers, with little or no relaxation from his
books, at last, as was only to be expected from
a high-spirited lad, he broke over the traces.
Handsome and graceful, he found his pleasure
with women: a fault which his father, now
created Marquis of Wharton, could overlook in
consideration of his son’s promise in other directions.
However, the young man destroyed all the
Marquis’s hope of an alliance with some lady of
high rank and vast wealth by secretly espousing,
at the Fleet, on 2nd March 1715, when he was
in his seventeenth year, Martha, the penniless
daughter of Major-General Holmes&mdash;a proceeding
that the Marquis took so much to heart that,
it was said, his death six weeks later was directly
attributable to his grief and anger.</p>

<p>The effects of this madcap escapade might not
have been very serious, for there was nothing to
be urged against the girl except her lack of money
and great connections, if the accomplished fact
had been recognised in the right spirit by the
young husband’s family; in which case, it is
more than probable, his career might have been
very different. As it was, however, his mother and<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
his father’s trustees, Lord Dorchester, Lord Carlisle,
and Nicholas Lechmere, thought it advisable temporarily
to separate man and wife, and sent the
Marquis abroad in charge of a French Protestant.</p>

<p>In this uncongenial company Philip visited
Holland and Hanover and other German courts,
and eventually settled down at Geneva. There
he remained for a while, galled by the restrictions
upon his personal liberty by the tutor, and infuriated
by the inadequacy of the income allowed
him by his trustees. The latter annoyance he
overcame by raising money at, of course, exorbitant
interest; the former by the simple expedient
of running away from Geneva without
his companion, who, a few hours after the flight
of his charge, received from the latter a note:
“Being no longer able to bear your ill-usage, I
have thought proper to be gone from you; however,
that you may not want company, I have
left you the bear, as the most suitable companion
in the world that could be picked out for you!”</p>

<div><p class="tac fs120"><i>Philip, Duke of Wharton</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Marquis made his way to Lyons, where
he arrived on 13th October 1716, and from there
he sent a complimentary letter to the son of
James II. at Avignon, and with the letter, as a
present, a magnificent horse. The Pretender,
delighted by the prospect of being able to detach
from the Hanoverian interest even an eighteen-<span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span>year-old
marquis, and especially the son of that very
pronounced Whig, Thomas Wharton, graciously
despatched one of his Court to invite Philip to
Avignon. There the lad went, stayed a day and
night, and received from his host the dangerous
compliment of an offer of the title of the Duke
of Northumberland, after which, to make matters
worse, he repaired to St Germain’s to pay his
respects to Mary, Queen Dowager of England.
The folly of his actions is the most remarkable
thing about them. Had he been attached to the
cause of the Chevalier de St George, the visits
would have been natural; had he even desired,
as so many had done, to be sufficiently attentive
to the Prince so as to be free from molestation
in case the latter should ever ascend the throne
of England, the visits would have been explicable;
but since he was not a Jacobite, and, if not
too honest, at least too careless of his personal
interest to be a “trimmer,” the only solution of
the matter is that his actions were dictated by a
spirit of revolt, the not unnatural reaction on
escaping from custody.</p>

<p>How little the Marquis meant by his visits&mdash;which,
in after days, he declared were mere
personal courtesies&mdash;may be deduced from the
fact that, as soon as he arrived at Paris, he called
on Lord Stair, the English Ambassador&mdash;at whose<span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
table, it is said, in a drunken frolic he proposed
the health of the Pretender! At a time when it
was a matter of vital importance to know who
was for and against the home Government, and
when a fortune was spent on spies, Lord Stair,
of course, knew that the Marquis had been to
Avignon and St Germain’s; but if he did not
close his ears to the tales of the young man’s
doings, at least he did not avert his countenance
from him. On the contrary, he received him
with every attention, realising that here was, so
to speak, a brand to be plucked from the burning.
The lad was only eighteen, and so indiscretions
might be dismissed as of no importance; whereas
to dwell on them unduly would perhaps turn
him into a Jacobite. Therefore much show of
kindness was diplomatic, coupled, Lord Stair
thought, with a trifle of admonition.</p>

<p>However, when the Ambassador began to utter
a word in season, the Marquis did not show himself
amenable to advice. Indeed, when Lord
Stair, extolling the virtues of his guest’s father,
said, “I hope you will follow so illustrious an
example of fidelity to your Prince and love to
your country,” the Marquis retorted, “I thank
your Excellency for your good counsel, and as
your Excellency had also a worthy and deserving
father, I hope that you will likewise copy so<span class="pagenum" title="259"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span>
bright an original and tread in all his steps”&mdash;which
reply, though showing a keen sense of
humour, was brutal, for the first Lord Stair had
unhesitatingly betrayed his sovereign!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Marquis would tolerate
no interference, and when a friend, whether or
not set to task by Lord Stair has not transpired,
expostulated with him for having abandoned the
principles of his father, “I have pawned my
principles,” he said jauntily, “to Gordon, the
Pretender’s banker, for a considerable sum; and
till I have the money to repay him, I must be
a Jacobite; but,” he added, “as soon as I have
redeemed them, I shall be a Whig again!”</p>

<p>Perhaps this remark was conveyed to the
Marquis’s trustees, for it is to be presumed that
the Marquis’s financial obligations were discharged,
since on his arrival in Ireland at the
beginning of 1717 the Government seems to
have connived at his taking his seat as Marquis
Castlereagh, in the Irish House of Lords, though
only in his nineteenth year&mdash;“which,” Budgell
wrote to Mr Secretary Addison, “is the
highest compliment that could have been paid
to him.” Here Philip showed an apparently
earnest desire to atone for his misdemeanours
abroad, and his great talents made the task easy.
He took a prominent part in debate, sat on com<span class="pagenum" title="260"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span>mittees,
and in his official capacity conducted
himself so that the British Government, congratulating
themselves on their tact in having made
light of his doings in France, thought it well to
endeavour to bend him still more closely to their
interests, by bestowing on him, perhaps as a set-off
against the ducal title offered by the Pretender,
an English dukedom.</p>

<p>“As it is the honour of subjects, who are
descended from an illustrious family, to imitate
the great examples of their ancestors, we esteem
it no less our glory, as a King, after the manner
of our predecessors, to dignify eminent methods
by suitable rewards,” so ran the preamble to the
patent. “It is on this account that we confer a
new title on our right trusty and entirely beloved
cousin, Philip Marquis of Wharton and Malmesbury,
who though he be born of a very ancient
noble family, wherein he may reckon as many
patriots as forefathers, has rather chosen to distinguish
himself by his personal merit. The
British nation, not forgetful of his father lately
deceased, gratefully remember how much their
invincible King William III. owed to that constant
and courageous assistor of the public liberty
and the Protestant religion. The same extraordinary
person deserved so well of us, in having
supported our interests by the weight of his<span class="pagenum" title="261"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
councils, the force of his wit, and the firmness
of his mind, at a time when our title to the
succession of this realm was endangered; that
in the beginning of our reign we invested him
with the dignity of a Marquis, as an earnest of
our royal favour, the farther marks whereof we
were prevented from bestowing by his death, too
hasty, and untimely for his King and Country.
When we see the son of that great man, forming
himself by so worthy an example, and in
every action exhibiting a lively resemblance to
his father; when we consider the eloquence
which he has exerted with so much applause
in the parliament of Ireland; and his turn and
application, even in early youth, to the serious
and weighty affairs of the public, we willingly
decree him honours, which are neither superior
to his merits, nor earlier than the expectation of
our good subjects.”</p>

<p>Vanity, it is generally assumed, was the moving
spirit of the new Duke of Wharton, and it seems
that to have earned a dukedom at twenty years of
age temporarily lulled that passion, for, after the
bestowal of that high honour, the recipient seems
to have rested on his oars, and for the next year
to have abandoned himself to unbridled excesses in
drink and profligacy. “Aye, my lord,” said Swift,
who admired his talents, when his Grace had<span class="pagenum" title="262"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>
been recounting some of his frolics to the Dean
of St Patrick’s, “Aye, my lord, you have had
many frolics; but let me recommend you one
more: take a frolic to be virtuous; I assure
you it will do you more honour than all the
rest!”</p>

<p>Whether caused by Swift’s words, or whether
it was the swing of the pendulum, on coming of
age Philip made a complete change in his mode
of living, and for a while led a decent private life.
“The Duke of Wharton has brought his Duchess
to town, and is fond of her to distraction; to
break the hearts of all the other women that
have any claim on his,” Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu wrote to her sister, Lady Mar. “He
has public devotions twice a day, and assists at
them in person with exemplary devotion; and
there is nothing pleasanter than the remarks of
some great pious ladies on the conversion of so
great a sinner.” How long this period of conjugal
fidelity might have endured is uncertain, but it
was brought to an untimely end when the
Duchess, in defiance of her husband’s command,
came from Winchendon to London, bringing
with her their child, the twelve-months’ old
Earl of Malmesbury, who in the metropolis
caught smallpox and died. This, it is said by
all loyal biographers, so affected his Grace that,<span class="pagenum" title="263"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span>
regarding the bereavement as caused by the
violation of his wishes, he could not bear the
sight of his wife. Persons less prone to sentiment
than biographers may perhaps see in this yet
another swing of the pendulum.</p>

<p>If the Duke’s private life was for a while
exemplary, the same cannot at any time be said
of his political career. A young man may change
his opinion once without giving serious offence,
he may even be forgiven for reverting to his
earlier beliefs, but he can expect but scant
mercy if he chops and changes with every breath
of wind. At Avignon Philip had accepted a title
from the Pretender, in Ireland he had accepted
a dukedom from George I. as a reward for his
vigorous support of the ministry; but now, when
he took his seat in the English Parliament, to the
general astonishment, he threw himself into uncompromising
opposition.</p>

<p>The report of his great talents, his brilliant
oratory, and his powers as a debater had reached
Westminster, where his appearance was eagerly
awaited, and he felt it incumbent upon him to
show that rumour had not magnified his gifts;
on 24th April 1720 he took part in a debate on
a Bill to give further powers to the South Sea
Company, and made a magnificent onslaught not
only on this proposal, but on the entire policy<span class="pagenum" title="264"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span>
of the Government, concluding with a terrible
attack on Lord Stanhope, whom he accused of
having made, or at least of having fostered, the
breach between the King and the Prince of
Wales, comparing him to Sejanus, “that evil
and too powerful minister who made a division
in the Imperial party, and rendered the reign of
Tiberius hateful to the Romans.” Lord Stanhope
was not the man to sit quiet under such castigation,
and he turned the tables on his assailant
with undoubted dexterity. “The Romans were
most certainly a great people, and furnished many
illustrious examples in their history, which ought
to be carefully read,” he said in reply. “The
Romans were likewise universally allowed to be
a wise people, and they showed themselves to
be so in nothing more than by debarring young
noblemen from speaking in the Senate till
they understood good manners and propriety
of language; and as the Duke has quoted an
instance from this history of a bad minister,
I beg leave to quote from the same history
an instance of a great man, a patriot of his
country, who had a son so profligate that he
would have betrayed the liberties of it, on which
account his father himself had him whipped to
death.”</p>

<p>The Minister’s apt retort rankled, and it<span class="pagenum" title="265"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span>
doubtless did much to confirm the Duke in
his attitude. He spoke against the Government,
not only in the House of Lords, but in the City
of London and in the country; and in the following
year, returning to the question of the South
Sea Company’s affairs, he attacked Lord Stanhope
in so brilliant and bitter a speech that the
latter, rising in a passion to reply, broke a blood-vessel,
from the effects of which he died on the
following day. It was somewhat later that the
Duke attacked Lord Chancellor Macclesfield,
suspected and eventually found guilty of fraud
in connection with the South Sea Company’s
affairs, not only by word of mouth, but also in
a satirical ballad entitled “An Epistle from John
Sheppard to the Earl of Macclesfield”:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having established his fame as an orator with
his speeches on the South Sea question, Wharton
gained yet further distinction by his impassioned
defence of Bishop Atterbury, but what reputation
he gained as a speaker he lost in honour, for he had
obtained the material for his oration by a mean
trick. The day before he spoke he went to Sir
Robert Walpole, told him he was sorry for his
opposition to the Government and intended to
reinstate himself in favour at Court and with the
Ministry by speaking against the Bishop, and he
begged the Prime Minister to give him some
assistance in preparing his arguments. Walpole
went carefully over the ground with his visitor,
and showed him the strong and the weak points
of the case. The Duke expressed his thanks,
spent the night in a drinking bout, and, without
going to bed, went to the House of Lords and
spoke <i>for</i> the Bishop, making use most effectively
of the information he had obtained on the previous
day. Then, when sentence of banishment was
pronounced on the Bishop, he saw him off, and,
returning home, wrote and published some verses
on “The Banishment of Cicero,” in which, of<span class="pagenum" title="267"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></span>
course, the Bishop was Cicero, and George I.
Clodius, concluding:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Let Clodius now in grandeur reign,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Let him exert his power,</div>

<div class="verse">And dares, or truly speaks, or bravely die!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the meantime the Duke had reverted to
his dissipated habits in private life, and it amused
and annoyed many of his contemporaries that in
public he, the President of the Hell-fire Club,
should, on the ground of morality, inveigh against
various measures. Wharton, however, paid little
or no heed to those who held the view that
a profligate is not the proper person to preach
virtue; but when the King in council, on
29th April 1721, issued a proclamation against
“certain scandalous clubs or society, who in the
most impious and blasphemous manner insult the
most sacred principles of our holy religion, and
corrupt the minds and morals of one another,”<span class="pagenum" title="268"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a></span>
Wharton, as President of the Hell-fire Club,
rose in his place in the House of Lords, declared
he was not, as was thought, a “patron of blasphemy,”
and, pulling out a Bible, proceeded to
read several texts.</p>

<p>He went occasionally to his seat in Westmoreland,
and was a frequent visitor to the seat of his
kinsman, Sir Christopher Musgrave, at Edenhall,
where was preserved the great crystal goblet,
supposed to have been seized by some earlier
Musgrave from a fairy banquet, and known as
“The Luck of Edenhall.” The legend ran:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
“If this glass do break or fall,<br />
Farewell the luck of Edenhall!”<br />
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>but in spite of this warning the Duke, out of
sheer devilment, would toss the goblet high in
the air, and once, but for a wary butler, it would
have fallen to the ground and have been smashed
to atoms. It was at Edenhall that the Homeric
drinking match took place, which Wharton, its
proposer, celebrated in verse in the form of “An
Imitation of Chevvy-Chace.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So began the ballad, and it goes on to tell how
the news of the battle spread, how others then
hastened to the board, and fell, man by man,
overcome by their potations.</p>

<p>The Duke, however, did not care for his place
in the north, and was more frequently to be
found at Twickenham, a fact duly noted by
Horace Walpole in his “Parish Register” of
that village:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Twickenham, where frolic Wharton revelled,</div>
<div class="verse">Where Montagu, with locks dishevelled,</div>
<div class="verse">Conflict of dirt and warmth combin’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Invoked,&mdash;and scandalised the <i>Nine</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was not by accident that Walpole put these<span class="pagenum" title="270"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a></span>
names in juxtaposition, for there was a great
intimacy between the two, and it was said,
probably with reason, that it was the Duke’s
attentions to the lady that turned Pope’s affection
to hatred and caused the historic breach
between them. But though Lady Mary “Worldly”
Montagu, as Philip called her, may have been
attached to the Duke, she was never in any
doubt as to the worthlessness of his professions of
love. “In general, gallantry never was in so elevated
a figure as it is at present,” she told Lady
Mar. “Twenty very pretty fellows (the Duke of
Wharton being president and chief director) have
formed themselves into a committee of gallantry.
They call themselves <i>Schemers</i>; and meet regularly
three times a week, to consult on gallant schemes
for the advantage and advancement of that branch
of happiness.”</p>

<p>Wharton’s gallantries, or, to give them their
proper though less euphonious name, profligacies,
were carried to such excess that they, together
with his political infidelities, disgusted even his
far from strait-laced contemporaries; and it
was only his great talents that enabled him to
hold his own with them. But his marvellous gift
of oratory and his ingenious but always sound
reasoning were appreciated even by, or, perhaps,
it should be said, especially by, his enemies; while<span class="pagenum" title="271"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a></span>
his occasional outbursts of humour made it difficult
for anyone to keep a straight face. Who could
help laughing when a certain Bishop in the House
of Lords rose to speak and remarked he should
divide what he had to say into twelve parts, and
Wharton, interrupting, begged he might be
permitted to tell a story that could only be introduced
at that moment: “A drunken fellow
was passing by St Paul’s at night, and heard the
clock slowly chiming twelve. He counted the
strokes, and when it was finished, looking towards
the clock, said, ‘Damn you, why couldn’t you
give us all that at once?’&#8239;” There was an end of
the Bishop’s speech!</p>

<p>But not great talents, combined with a keen
sense of humour, could save a person as volatile
as the Duke. He founded in 1723 an Opposition
paper, <i>The True Briton</i>, written by himself, issued
twice weekly, which secured a large circulation,
and for publishing which, Payne, indicted for libel,
and found guilty, was heavily fined; but this may
be regarded as a legitimate political move. As
he was known to be in correspondence with the
Pretender, it is not easy to see how he escaped
impeachment, unless it was that the Government
was reluctant to proceed against a young man,
the son of a valued supporter and an old
friend of Sir Robert Walpole, and the godson<span class="pagenum" title="272"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a></span>
of the two preceding sovereigns of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>The Government, however, was soon relieved
from any anxiety on this score, for the Duke’s
extravagance in money matters had been so great
that his creditors had, for their own benefit, obtained
a decree of the Court of Chancery placing
his estates in the hands of trustees until his liabilities
had been liquidated. These trustees
allowed his Grace an income of twelve hundred
pounds, upon which, deciding it was impossible
in this country to support his dignity on that
sum, he left England, thus bringing to a close
the first act of his wasted life.</p>

<p>Before the Duke went abroad he had been
careful to make his peace with the Pretender,
for the latter, writing in 1725 to Atterbury,
then at Paris, says: “I am very glad you were to
send into England <span class="ell">..</span>. for everybody is not so
active as Lord Wharton, who writes me often
and wants no spur.” The Pretender had not yet
discovered the danger of a follower so wayward
and unreliable as this young man, who did more
harm than good to any cause he espoused; and
so, when the Duke arrived on the Continent in
May 1725, he sent him as envoy to Vienna to
do his utmost to promote a good understanding
between his master and the Emperor Charles VI.<span class="pagenum" title="273"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a></span>
In this Wharton was not altogether unsuccessful,
and when he reported the result of his mission
the Chevalier de St George, then resident at
Rome, rewarded him with the empty title of
Duke of Northumberland and the Order of the
Garter.</p>

<p>In the following April the Duke was sent to
Madrid, where his folly became notorious. “The
Duke of Wharton has not been sober, or scarce had
a pipe out of his mouth, since he came back from
his expedition to St Ildefonso,” wrote Mr (afterwards
Sir Benjamin) Keene, British Ambassador
at Madrid. “He declared himself to be the Pretender’s
Prime Minister, and Duke of Wharton
and Northumberland. Hitherto, added he, my
master’s interest has been managed by the Duke
of Perth and three or four old women, who meet
under the portal of St Germain’s. He wanted a
Whig, and a brisk one too, to put them in a right
train, and I am the man. You may now look upon
me, Sir Philip Wharton, knight of the Garter,
and Sir Robert Walpole, knight of the Bath,
running a course,&mdash;and, by heaven! he shall be
pressed hard. He bought my family pictures,
but they shall not be long in his possession; that
account is still open.” In spite of the Duke’s
follies, the Court of Spain did not show itself so
unfriendly to him, and to the cause he represented,<span class="pagenum" title="274"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a></span>
as Keene thought it should; and he warned his
Government. The reply from England came in the
form of a summons under the Privy Seal to the
Duke to return at once to his own country&mdash;a
summons which, it is needless to say, was ignored
by the recipient.</p>

<p>While at Madrid Philip learnt that his wife,
whom he had left in London, had died, and
forthwith he proposed to Maria, the daughter of
Colonel Henry O’Beirne, a lady-in-waiting to
the Queen of Spain. Her Majesty raised various
objections, but was eventually persuaded to consent
to the alliance, which took place in July
1726, after the Duke had embraced the Roman
Catholic faith, a step he took in spite of the fact
that on 17th June he had written to his sister,
Lady Jane Holt, assuring her he would never
forsake the religion in which he had been born
and bred.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Duke changed his faith
to win his bride, but there may have been at the
back of his mind the thought that it would please
his master. If this was so, it was an entirely mistaken
idea, because his conversion&mdash;occurring at
the same time as that of Lord North, who had
also left England and abjured the Hanoverian
cause&mdash;gave the impression that to be in favour
with the Chevalier de St George it was necessary<span class="pagenum" title="275"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span>
to be of his faith, which in English eyes was a
fatal objection. This, indeed, the Chevalier had
realised, as may be gathered from a letter of the
Duchess of Orleans, so far back as 10th September
1712: “Our King of England, I mean the true
one, no longer dislikes Protestants, for he has taken
many of them for his servants.” What Atterbury
thought of the Duke’s action, he said very clearly
in a letter to the Pretender: “The strange turn
taken by the Duke of Wharton gave me such
mortifying apprehensions that I have forborne
for some posts to mention him at all. You say,
Sir, that he advised with few of his friends in
this matter. I am of opinion he advised with
none. It is easy to suppose you were both surprised
and concerned at the account when it first
reached Rome, since it is impossible you should
not be so; the ill consequences are so many, so
great, and so evident, that I am not only afflicted
but bewildered when I think of them. The mischief
of one thing you mention is, that he will
scarce be believed in what he shall say in that
occasion (so low will his credit have sunk), nor
be able effectually to stop the mouth of malice
by any after declaration.” In England nothing
that the Duke of Wharton could do created
any astonishment, such was the estimate in
which he was held in his own country; and<span class="pagenum" title="276"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a></span>
popular opinion was expressed by Curll in an
epigram:</p>

<p class="tac"><i>On the Duke of Wharton Renouncing the Protestant Religion</i>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza1">
<div class="verse outdent">“A <i>Whig</i> He was bred, but at length is turn’d <i>Papist</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">Pray God send the next Remove be not an <i>Atheist</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="tac">“<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;To believe <i>every Thing</i> and <i>Nothing</i> is much the same.”
</p>

<p>After his marriage, the Duke paid a visit to
his master at Rome, but he “could not keep
himself within the bounds of the Italian gravity,”
and the Chevalier ordered him and his wife to
return to Spain. There he volunteered to serve
with the Spanish army in the siege of Gibraltar.
Hitherto there had been some suspicion of his
courage, but that slur he now wiped off by
exposing his person freely; indeed, the story goes
that one day he walked from the Spanish camp
to the very walls of Gibraltar, and, when
challenged, declared his identity, and sauntered
back leisurely, the soldiers, unwilling to kill a
great nobleman of their own nationality, holding
their fire.</p>

<p>After the siege, the Duke returned to Madrid,
where he was given the rank of Colonel-Aggregate
to the Irish regiment, Hibernia, in the
Spanish service, commanded by the Marquis de
Castelar; and then proposed to settle for a while
at the Pretender’s Court. That royal personage,<span class="pagenum" title="277"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></span>
however, had by this time realised that his adherent’s
gifts were so handicapped by various
undesirable qualities that he showed very plainly
that he wished any intimate connection should
cease: he did, indeed, consent to grant a last interview
at Parma, but he neutralised the effect
of this favour by taking the opportunity to refuse
to allow the Duke to reside at his Court.</p>

<p>The Duke took the rebuff in good part, wrote
to the Chevalier reiterating his great and enduring
devotion to the Jacobite cause, and,
journeying with his wife to Paris, in that city
at once made overtures to Horace Walpole, the
British Ambassador. “I am coming to Paris, to
put myself entirely under your Excellency’s protection,
and hope that Sir Robert Walpole’s good
nature will prompt him to save a family, which
his generosity induced him to spare,” he wrote
in May 1728. “If your Excellency would permit
me to wait upon you for an hour, I am certain
you would be convinced of the sincerity of my
repentance for my former madness; would become
an advocate with his Majesty to grant me
his most gracious pardon, which it is my comfort
I shall never be required to purchase by any
step unworthy of a man of honour. I do not intend,
in the case of the king’s allowing me to
pass the evening of my days under the shadow of<span class="pagenum" title="278"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></span>
his royal protection, to see England for some
years, but shall remain in France or Germany, as
my friends shall advise, and enjoy country sports
till all former stories are buried in oblivion. I beg of
your Excellency to let me receive your orders at
Paris, which I will send to your hotel to receive.
The Duchess of Wharton, who is with me, desires
leave to wait on Mrs Walpole, if you think proper.”</p>

<p>Horace Walpole received him, listened to his
assurances of future loyalty, and conveyed his
protestations of good behaviour to the Duke of
Newcastle, who replied on 12th July:</p>

<p>“Having laid before the King your Excellency’s
letter, giving an account of a visit
you had received from the Duke of Wharton,
and enclosing a copy of a letter he wrote to you
afterwards upon the same occasion, I am commanded
to let you know that his Majesty approves
of what you said to the Duke, and your behaviour
towards him; but that the Duke of Wharton has
conducted himself in so extraordinary a manner
since he left England, and has so openly declared
his disaffection to the King and his government,
by joining with and serving under his Majesty’s
professed enemies, that his Majesty does not
think fit to receive any application from him.”</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to give in detail the subsequent<span class="pagenum" title="279"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span>
actions of the Duke: how, incensed by the King’s
refusal, he printed in <i>Mist’s Journal</i> a bitter
satirical attack on George II. and his ministers;
how he was tried for high treason for having
taken up arms against his country, found guilty,
outlawed, and deprived of his property; how at
the eleventh hour unofficial overtures were made
to him from England, which he refused to entertain
unless unconditional pardon was granted
him; how he stayed awhile in a monastery, a
fervent devotee, and after a few weeks returned
to the world to plunge into greater excesses;
how he publicly proclaimed his attachment to
the Pretender and the Catholic religion.</p>

<p>His estates being sequestrated, he was now
penniless, and reduced to most miserable straits.
“Notwithstanding what my Brother Madman
has done to undo himself, and everybody who
was so unlucky as to have the least concern with
him,” wrote a friend who journeyed with him
from Paris to Orleans at the beginning of June
1729, “I could not help being sensibly moved
at so extraordinary a vicissitude of fortune, to see
a great man fallen from that shining light, in
which I have beheld him in the House of Lords,
to such a degree of obscurity, that I have observed
the meanest commoner decline his company;
and the Jew he would sometimes fasten on, grow<span class="pagenum" title="280"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a></span>
tired of it; for you know he is but a bad orator
in his cups, and of late he has been but seldom
sober.” Eventually, after overcoming great difficulties,
the Duke arrived in Spain, where he
joined his regiment, and endeavoured to live upon
his pay of eighteen pistoles a month, and sums
of money sent to him by the Pretender. He devoted
his leisure to reading and to the composition
of a play based on the tragic story of Mary
Queen of Scots, and, after an illness of some
months, he died on 31st May 1731, at the age
of thirty-two, in the shelter of the Franciscan
monastery of Poblet.</p>

<p>Such is the story of the life of Philip, Duke of
Wharton, which, surely, arouses feelings of pity
rather than anger. “Like Buckingham and
Rochester,” says Horace Walpole, “he comforted
all the grave and dull by throwing away the
brightest profusion of parts on witty fooleries,
debaucheries, and scrapes, which may mix graces
with a great character, but can never compose
one.” He had, indeed, genius, wit, humour,
eloquence, rank, wealth and good looks, but because
he lacked stability and principles, all his
great talents went for nothing. Never was there
a character more fitted to point a moral, and if
the writers of Sunday school prize-books have
not taken him as their text, this can only be be<span class="pagenum" title="281"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span>cause
they are unacquainted with his history.
“The great abilities of the Duke of Wharton
are past dispute,” Atterbury wrote to the Pretender,
in September 1736; “it is he alone who
could render them less useful than they might
have been.” And this was kindly put, for Atterbury
might well have said that as an adherent
to any cause so unreliable and faithless a person
was an open danger.</p>

<p>For every man some excuse can be found, but
while excuses for the Duke of Wharton there
must be, it is, indeed, not easy to find them.
His early training may have been unsuitable for
a character so mercurial, and the early death of
his mother and father probably removed any
change of controlling him. That he was mad is
a theory practical enough, for this would explain
many sudden changes of opinion, and many instances
of unfaithfulness, which had not even
self-interest to explain them; and it seems certain
that he was intoxicated with vanity. This last
assumption is supported by the testimony of
Pope, who has for all time put on record a
character sketch of the Duke, which, in spite of
the poet’s bias, must unfortunately be accepted
as a portrait all too true:</p>

and miniatures, some of which have never before been reproduced.</p>

<div class="box fs80 mt2em">
<p>The volume of memoirs which Miss Clementina Black has prepared
deals with a family group, nearly all the members of which
were personally interesting, and several of whom were closely
connected with the social and theatrical life of the latter half of the
18th century. Thomas Linley, the father, who was a musician of
distinction and probably the best singing-master whom England has
produced, lived for many years in Bath, where, from their very early
years, his children, all endowed with both talent and beauty, sang
and played with him at his concerts. The eldest daughter, generally
considered to be the finest singer and most beautiful woman of her
day, married Sheridan, and when her husband entered upon the
management of Drury Lane Theatre, Mr. Linley joined in the
undertaking. Both in Bath and in London the family’s circle of
friends was an interesting one, and many well-known names appear
in the various letters. One series of these, which are now published
for the first time, contains the history of the courtship of Miss Jane
Linley (who married in the year 1800) and presents a vivid picture
of social and family life from the point of view of a young lady in
the days of Jane Austen.</p>

<p>As, in addition to writing good letters, the family had a habit
of sitting for good portraits, their features have been recorded by
Reynolds, Gainsborough, Laurence, Westall and Cosway, and the
volume will be amply illustrated.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
